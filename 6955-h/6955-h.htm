      CHAPTER I &mdash; THE CABLE FROM MERVO
    </h2>
    <p>
      A pretty girl in a blue dress came out of the house, and began to walk
      slowly across the terrace to where Elsa Keith sat with Marvin Rossiter in
      the shade of the big sycamore. Elsa and Marvin had become engaged some few
      days before, and were generally to be found at this time sitting together
      in some shaded spot in the grounds of the Keith's Long Island home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's troubling Betty, I wonder," said Elsa. "She looks worried."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marvin turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your friend, Miss Silver?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Betty. We were at college together. I want you to like Betty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will. When did she arrive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night. She's here for a month. What's the matter, Betty? This is
      Marvin. I want you to like Marvin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty Silver smiled. Her face, in repose, was rather wistful, but it
      lighted up when she smiled, and an unsuspected dimple came into being on
      her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I shall," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her big gray eyes seemed to search Marvin's for an instant and Marvin had,
      almost subconsciously, a comfortable feeling that he had been tested and
      found worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you scowling at so ferociously, Betty?" asked Elsa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I scowling? I hope you didn't think it was at you. Oh, Elsa, I'm
      miserable! I shall have to leave this heavenly place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once. And I was meaning to have the most lovely time. See what has
      come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out some flimsy sheets of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cable!" said Elsa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Scott! it looks like the scenario of a four-act play," said Marvin.
      "That's not all one cable, surely? Whoever sent it must be a millionaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is. It's from my stepfather. Read it out, Elsa. I want Mr. Rossiter to
      hear it. He may be able to tell me where Mervo is. Did you ever hear of
      Mervo, Mr. Rossiter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a place where my stepfather is, and where I've got to go. I do call
      it hard. Go on, Elsa."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa, who had been skimming the document with raised eyebrows, now read it
      out in its spacious entirety.
    </p>

                                           <i>SCOBELL.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      "<i>Well!</i>" said Elsa, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George!" said Marvin. "He certainly seems to want you badly enough. He
      hasn't spared expense. He has put in about everything you could put into a
      cable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except why he wants me," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Elsa. "Why does he want you? And in such a desperate hurry,
      too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Marvin was re-reading the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't a mere invitation," he said. "There's no
      come-right-along-you'll-like-this-place-it's-fine about it. He seems to
      look on your company more as a necessity than a luxury. It's a sort of
      imperious C.Q.D."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what makes it so strange. We have hardly met for years. Why, he
      didn't even know where I was. The cable was sent to the bank and forwarded
      on. And I don't know where he is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which brings us back," said Marvin, "to mysterious Mervo. Let us reason
      inductively. If you get to the place by taking a boat from Marseilles, it
      can't be far from the French coast. I should say at a venture that Mervo
      is an island in the Mediterranean. And a small island for if it had been a
      big one we should have heard of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marvin!" cried Elsa, her face beaming with proud affection. "How clever
      you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere gift," he said modestly. "I have been like that from a boy." He
      got up from his chair. "Isn't there an encyclopaedia in the library,
      Elsa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it's an old edition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will probably touch on Mervo. I'll go and fetch it."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crossed the terrace, Elsa turned quickly to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a dear. Are you very happy, Elsa?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa's eyes danced. She drew in her breath softly. Betty looked at her in
      silence for a moment. The wistful expression was back on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elsa," she said, suddenly. "What is it like? How does it feel, knowing
      that there's someone who is fonder of you than anything&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's like eating berries and cream in a new dress by moonlight on a
      summer night while somebody plays the violin far away in the distance so
      that you can just hear it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes opened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it's like coming along on a winter evening and seeing the windows lit
      up and knowing you've reached home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was clenching her hands, and breathing quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it's like&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elsa, don't! I can't bear it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty! What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty smiled again, but painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's stupid of me. I'm just jealous, that's all. I haven't got a Marvin,
      you see. You have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there are plenty who would like to be your Marvin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's face grew cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are plenty who would like to be Benjamin Scobell's son-in-law," she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!" Elsa's voice was serious. "We've been friends for a good long
      time, so you'll let me say something, won't you? I think you're getting
      just the least bit hard. Now turn and rend me," she added good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to rend you," said Betty. "You're perfectly right. I am
      getting hard. How can I help it? Do you know how many men have asked me to
      marry them since I saw you last? Five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And not one of them cared the slightest bit about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Betty, dear, that's just what I mean. Why should you say that? How
      can you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do I know? Well, I do know. Instinct, I suppose. The instinct of
      self-preservation which nature gives hunted animals. I can't think of a
      single man in the world&mdash;except your Marvin, of course&mdash;who
      wouldn't do anything for money." She stopped. "Well, yes, one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa leaned forward eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, Betty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I am on the witness-stand&mdash;Maude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maude? I thought you said a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's his name. John Maude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Betty! Why didn't you tell me before? This is tremendously
      interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so very, really. I only met him two or three times, and I haven't
      seen him for years, and I don't suppose I shall ever see him again. He was
      a friend of Alice Beecher's brother, who was at Harvard. Alice took me
      over to meet her brother, and Mr. Maude was there. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsa was plainly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how do you know, then&mdash;? What makes you think that he&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instinct, again, I suppose. I do know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you've never met him since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty shook her head. Elsa relapsed into silence. She had a sense of
      pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the further end of the terrace Marvin Rossiter appeared, carrying a
      large volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are," he said. "Scared it up at the first attempt. Now then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, and opened the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't want to hear all about how Jason went there in search of the
      Golden Fleece, and how Ulysses is supposed to have taken it in on his
      round-trip? You want something more modern. Well, it's an island in the
      Mediterranean, as I said, and I'm surprised that you've never heard of it,
      Elsa, because it's celebrated in its way. It's the smallest independent
      state in the world. Smaller than Monaco, even. Here are some facts. Its
      population when this encyclopaedia was printed&mdash;there may be more now&mdash;was
      eleven thousand and sixteen. It was ruled over up to 1886 by a prince. But
      in that year the populace appear to have said to themselves, 'When in the
      course of human events....' Anyway, they fired the prince, and the place
      is now a republic. So that's where you're going, Miss Silver. I don't know
      if it's any consolation to you, but the island, according to this
      gentleman, is celebrated for the unspoilt beauty of its scenery. He also
      gives a list of the fish that can be caught there. It takes up about three
      lines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what can my stepfather be doing there? I last heard of him in London.
      Well, I suppose I shall have to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you will," said Elsa mournfully. "But, oh, Betty, what a
      shame!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II &mdash; MERVO AND ITS OWNER
    </h2>
    <p>
      "By heck!" cried Mr. Benjamin Scobell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled round from the window, and transferred his gaze from the view
      to his sister Marion; losing by the action, for the view was a joy to the
      eye, which his sister Marion was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun. Mr. Scobell's villa
      stood near the summit of the only hill the island possessed, and from the
      window of the morning-room, where he had just finished breakfast, he had
      an uninterrupted view of valley, town, and harbor&mdash;a two-mile riot of
      green, gold and white, and beyond the white the blue satin of the
      Mediterranean. Mr. Scobell did not read poetry except that which
      advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested, or he might
      have been reminded of the Island of Flowers in Tennyson's "Voyage of
      Maeldive." Violets, pinks, crocuses, yellow and purple mesembryanthemum,
      lavender, myrtle, and rosemary ... his two-mile view contained them all.
      The hillside below him was all aglow with the yellow fire of the mimosa.
      But his was not one of those emotional natures to which the meanest flower
      that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. A
      primrose by the river's brim a simple primrose was to him&mdash;or not so
      much a simple primrose, perhaps, as a basis for a possible Primrosina, the
      Soap that Really Cleans You.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a Paradise: a
      goblin in Fairyland. Somewhat below the middle height, he was lean of body
      and vulturine of face. He had a greedy mouth, a hooked nose, liquid green
      eyes and a sallow complexion. He was rarely seen without a half-smoked
      cigar between his lips. This at intervals he would relight, only to allow
      it to go out again; and when, after numerous fresh starts, it had dwindled
      beyond the limits of convenience, he would substitute another from the
      reserve supply that protruded from his vest-pocket.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      How Benjamin Scobell had discovered the existence of Mervo is not known.
      It lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier. But Mr. Scobell
      took a pride in the versatility of his finance. It distinguished him from
      the uninspired who were content to concentrate themselves on steel, wheat
      and such-like things. It was Mr. Scobell's way to consider nothing as
      lying outside his sphere. In a financial sense he might have taken
      Terence's <i>Nihil humanum alienum</i> as his motto. He was interested in
      innumerable enterprises, great and small. He was the power behind a
      company which was endeavoring, without much success, to extract gold from
      the mountains of North Wales, and another which was trying, without any
      success at all, to do the same by sea water. He owned a model farm in
      Indiana, and a weekly paper in New York. He had financed patent medicines,
      patent foods, patent corks, patent corkscrews, patent devices of all
      kinds, some profitable, some the reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also&mdash;outside the ordinary gains of finance&mdash;he had
      expectations. He was the only male relative of his aunt, the celebrated
      Mrs. Jane Oakley, who lived in a cottage on Staten Island, and was reputed
      to spend five hundred dollars a year&mdash;some said less&mdash;out of her
      snug income of eighteen million. She was an unusual old lady in many ways,
      and, unfortunately, unusually full of deep-rooted prejudices. The fear
      lest he might inadvertently fall foul of these rarely ceased to haunt Mr.
      Scobell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man of many projects had descended upon Mervo like a stone on the
      surface of some quiet pool, bubbling over with modern enterprise in
      general and, in particular, with a scheme. Before his arrival, Mervo had
      been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till
      to-morrow. The only really energetic thing it had ever done in its whole
      history had been to expel his late highness, Prince Charles, and change
      itself into a republic. And even that had been done with the minimum of
      fuss. The Prince was away at the time. Indeed, he had been away for nearly
      three years, the pleasures of Paris, London and Vienna appealing to him
      more keenly than life among his subjects. Mervo, having thought the matter
      over during these years, decided that it had no further use for Prince
      Charles. Quite quietly, with none of that vulgar brawling which its
      neighbor, France, had found necessary in similar circumstances, it had
      struck his name off the pay-roll, and declared itself a republic. The
      royalist party, headed by General Poineau, had been distracted but
      impotent. The army, one hundred and fifteen strong, had gone solid for the
      new regime, and that had settled it. Mervo had then gone to sleep again.
      It was asleep when Mr. Scobell found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The financier's scheme was first revealed to M. d'Orby, the President of
      the Republic, a large, stout statesman with even more than the average
      Mervian instinct for slumber. He was asleep in a chair on the porch of his
      villa when Mr. Scobell paid his call, and it was not until the financier's
      secretary, who attended the seance in the capacity of interpreter, had
      rocked him vigorously from side to side for quite a minute that he
      displayed any signs of animation beyond a snore like the growling of
      distant thunder. When at length he opened his eyes, he perceived the
      nightmare-like form of Mr. Scobell standing before him, talking. The
      financier, impatient of delay, had begun to talk some moments before the
      great awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," Mr. Scobell was saying, "I gotta proposition to which I'd like you
      to give your complete attention. Shake him some more, Crump. Sir, there's
      big money in it for all of us, if you and your crowd'll sit in. Money. <i>Lar'
      monnay</i>. No, that means change. What's money, Crump? <i>Arjong</i>?
      There's <i>arjong</i> in it, Squire. Get that? Oh, shucks! Hand it to him
      in French, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Secretary Crump translated. The President blinked, and intimated that
      he would hear more. Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar-stump, and proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, you've heard of <i>Moosieer</i> Blonk? Ask the old skeesicks if he's
      ever heard of <i>Mersyaw</i> Blonk, Crump, the feller who started the
      gaming-tables at Monte Carlo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Filtered through Mr. Crump, the question became intelligible to the
      President. He said he had heard of M. Blanc. Mr. Crump caught the reply
      and sent it on to Mr. Scobell, as the man on first base catches the ball
      and throws it to second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm in that line. I'm going to put this island on the map just like
      old Doctor Blonk put Monte Carlo. I've been studying up all about the old
      man, and I know just what he did and how he did it. Monte Carlo was just
      such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit it. The
      government was down to its last bean and wondering where the Heck its next
      meal-ticket was coming from, when in blows Mr. Man, tucks up his
      shirt-sleeves, and starts the tables. And after that the place never
      looked back. You and your crowd gotta get together and pass a vote to give
      me a gambling concession here, same as they did him. Scobell's my name.
      Hand him that, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump obliged once more. A gleam of intelligence came into the
      President's dull eye. He nodded once or twice. He talked volubly in French
      to Mr. Crump, who responded in the same tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The idea seems to strike him, sir," said Mr. Crump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to, if he isn't a clam," replied Mr. Scobell. He started to
      relight his cigar, but after scorching the tip of his nose, bowed to the
      inevitable and threw the relic away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here," he said, having bitten the end off the next in order; "I've
      thought this thing out from soup to nuts. There's heaps of room for
      another Monte Carlo. Monte's a dandy place, but it's not perfect by a long
      way. To start with, it's hilly. You have to take the elevator to get to
      the Casino, and when you've gotten to the end of your roll and want to
      soak your pearl pin, where's the hock-shop? Half a mile away up the side
      of a mountain. It ain't right. In my Casino there's going to be a resident
      pawnbroker inside the building, just off the main entrance. That's only
      one of a heap of improvements. Another is that my Casino's scheduled to be
      a home from home, a place you can be real cosy in. You'll look around you,
      and the only thing you'll miss will be mother's face. Yes, sir, there's no
      need for a gambling Casino to look and feel and smell like the
      reading-room at the British Museum. Comfort, coziness and convenience.
      That's the ticket I'm running on. Slip that to the old gink, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      A further outburst of the French language from Mr. Crump, supplemented on
      the part of the "old gink" by gesticulations, interrupted the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's he saying now?" asked Mr. Scobell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants to know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell. Let me guess. He wants to know what sort of a rake-off he and
      the other somnambulists will get&mdash;the darned old pirate! Is that it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump said that that was just it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll be all right," said Mr. Scobell. "Old man Blong's offer to the
      Prince of Monaco was five hundred thousand francs a year&mdash;that's
      somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in real money&mdash;and half
      the profits made by the Casino. That's my offer, too. See how that hits
      him, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump investigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says he accepts gladly, on behalf of the Republic, sir," he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. d'Orby confirmed the statement by rising, dodging the cigar, and
      kissing Mr. Scobell on both cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cut it out," said the financier austerely, breaking out of the clinch.
      "We'll take the Apache Dance as read. Good-by, Squire. Glad it's settled.
      Now I can get busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did. Workmen poured into Mervo, and in a very short time, dominating
      the town and reducing to insignificance the palace of the late Prince,
      once a passably imposing mansion, there rose beside the harbor a mammoth
      Casino of shining stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imposing as was the exterior, it was on the interior that Mr. Scobell more
      particularly prided himself, and not without reason. Certainly, a man with
      money to lose could lose it here under the most charming conditions. It
      had been Mr. Scobell's object to avoid the cheerless grandeur of the rival
      institution down the coast. Instead of one large hall sprinkled with
      tables, each table had a room to itself, separated from its neighbor by
      sound-proof folding-doors. And as the building progressed, Mr. Scobell's
      active mind had soared above the original idea of domestic coziness to far
      greater heights of ingenuity. Each of the rooms was furnished and arranged
      in a different style. The note of individuality extended even to the <i>croupiers</i>.
      Thus, a man with money at his command could wander from the Dutch room,
      where, in the picturesque surroundings of a Dutch kitchen, <i>croupiers</i>
      in the costume of Holland ministered to his needs, to the Japanese room,
      where his coin would be raked in by quite passable imitations of the
      Samurai. If he had any left at this point, he was free to dispose of it
      under the auspices of near-Hindoos in the Indian room, of merry Swiss
      peasants in the Swiss room, or in other appropriately furnished apartments
      of red-shirted, Bret Harte miners, fur-clad Esquimaux, or languorous
      Spaniards. He could then, if a man of spirit, who did not know when he was
      beaten, collect the family jewels, and proceed down the main hall,
      accompanied by the strains of an excellent band, to the office of a
      gentlemanly pawnbroker, who spoke seven languages like a native and was
      prepared to advance money on reasonable security in all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a colossal venture, but it suffered from the defect from which most
      big things suffer; it moved slowly. That it also moved steadily was to
      some extent a consolation to Mr. Scobell. Undoubtedly it would progress
      quicker and quicker, as time went on, until at length the Casino became a
      permanent gold mine. But at present it was being conducted at a loss. It
      was inevitable, but it irked Mr. Scobell. He paced the island and brooded.
      His mind dwelt incessantly on the problem. Ideas for promoting the
      prosperity of his nursling came to him at all hours&mdash;at meals, in the
      night watches, when he was shaving, walking, washing, reading, brushing
      his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now one had come to him as he stood looking at the view from the
      window of his morning-room, listening absently to his sister Marion as she
      read stray items of interest from the columns of the <i>New York Herald</i>,
      and had caused him to utter the exclamation recorded at the beginning of
      the chapter.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "By Heck!" he said. "Read that again, Marion. I gottan idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Scobell, deep in her paper, paid no attention. Few people would have
      taken her for the sister of the financier. She was his exact opposite in
      almost every way. He was small, jerky and aggressive; she, tall,
      deliberate and negative. She was one of those women whom nature seems to
      have produced with the object of attaching them to some man in a peculiar
      position of independent dependence, and who defy the imagination to
      picture them in any other condition whatsoever. One could not see Miss
      Scobell doing anything but pour out her brother's coffee, darn his socks,
      and sit placidly by while he talked. Yet it would have been untrue to
      describe her as dependent upon him. She had a detached mind. Though her
      whole life had been devoted to his comfort and though she admired him
      intensely, she never appeared to give his conversation any real attention.
      She listened to him much as she would have listened to a barking
      Pomeranian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marion!" cried Mr. Scobell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A five-legged rabbit has been born in Carbondale, Southern Illinois," she
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell cursed the five-legged rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind about your rabbits. I want to hear that piece you read before.
      The one about the Prince of Monaco. Will&mdash;you&mdash;listen, Marion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Prince of Monaco, dear? Yes. He has caught another fish or something
      of that sort, I think. Yes. A fish with 'telescope eyes,' the paper says.
      And very convenient too, I should imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell thumped the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got it. I've found out what's the matter with this darned place. I
      see why the Casino hasn't struck its gait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> think it must be the <i>croupiers</i>, dear. I'm sure I never
      heard of <i>croupiers</i> in fancy costume before. It doesn't seem right.
      I'm sure people don't like those nasty Hindoos. I am quite nervous myself
      when I go into the Indian room. They look at me so oddly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! That's the whole idea of the place, that it should be
      different. People are sick and tired of having their money gathered in by
      seedy-looking Dagoes in second-hand morning coats. We give 'em variety.
      It's not the Casino that's wrong: it's the darned island. What's the use
      of a republic to a place like this? I'm not saying that you don't want a
      republic for a live country that's got its way to make in the world; but
      for a little runt of a sawn-off, hobo, one-night stand like this you gotta
      have something picturesque, something that'll advertise the place,
      something that'll give a jolt to folks' curiosity, and make 'em talk!
      There's this Monaco gook. He snoops around in his yacht, digging up
      telescope-eyed fish, and people talk about it. 'Another darned fish,' they
      say. 'That's the 'steenth bite the Prince of Monaco has had this year.'
      It's like a soap advertisement. It works by suggestion. They get to
      thinking about the Prince and his pop-eyed fishes, and, first thing they
      know, they've packed their grips and come along to Monaco to have a peek
      at him. And when they're there, it's a safe bet they aren't going back
      again without trying to get a mess of easy money from the Bank. That's
      what this place wants. Whoever heard of this blamed Republic doing
      anything except eat and sleep? They used to have a prince here 'way back
      in eighty-something. Well, I'm going to have him working at the old stand
      again, right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Scobell looked up from her paper, which she had been reading with
      absorbed interest throughout tins harangue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear?" she said enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say I'm going to have him back again," said Mr. Scobell, a little
      damped. "I wish you would listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you're quite right, dear. Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Prince. Do listen, Marion. The Prince of this island, His Highness,
      the Prince of Mervo. I'm going to send for him and put him on the throne
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't, dear. He's dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know he's dead. You can't faze me on the history of this place. He died
      in ninety-one. But before he died he married an American girl, and there's
      a son, who's in America now, living with his uncle. It's the son I'm going
      to send for. I got it all from General Poineau. He's a royalist. He'll be
      tickled to pieces when Johnny comes marching home again. Old man Poineau
      told me all about it. The Prince married a girl called Westley, and then
      he was killed in an automobile accident, and his widow went back to
      America with the kid, to live with her brother. Poineau says he could lay
      his hand on him any time he pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you won't do anything rash, dear," said his sister comfortably.
      "I'm sure we don't want any horrid revolution here, with people shooting
      and stabbing each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revolution?" cried Mr. Scobell. "Revolution! Well, I should say nix!
      Revolution nothing. I'm the man with the big stick in Mervo. Pretty near
      every adult on this island is dependent on my Casino for his weekly
      envelope, and what I say goes&mdash;without argument. I want a prince, so
      I gotta have a prince, and if any gazook makes a noise like a man with a
      grouch, he'll find himself fired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Scobell turned to her paper again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, dear," she said. "Just as you please. I'm sure you know best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure!" said her brother. "You're a good guesser. I'll go and beat up old
      man Poineau right away."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III &mdash; JOHN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ten days after Mr. Scobell's visit to General Poineau, John, Prince of
      Mervo, ignorant of the greatness so soon to be thrust upon him, was
      strolling thoughtfully along one of the main thoroughfares of that outpost
      of civilization, Jersey City. He was a big young man, tall and large of
      limb. His shoulders especially were of the massive type expressly designed
      by nature for driving wide gaps in the opposing line on the gridiron. He
      looked like one of nature's center-rushes, and had, indeed, played in that
      position for Harvard during two strenuous seasons. His face wore an
      expression of invincible good-humor. He had a wide, good-natured mouth,
      and a pair of friendly gray eyes. One felt that he liked his fellow men
      and would be surprised and pained if they did not like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed along the street, he looked a little anxious. Sherlock Holmes&mdash;and
      possibly even Doctor Watson&mdash;would have deduced that he had something
      on his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to a large office building, he paused, and seemed to
      hesitate. Then, as if he had made up his mind to face an ordeal, he went
      in and pressed the button of the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the elevator at the third floor, he went down the passage, and
      pushed open a door on which was inscribed the legend, "Westley, Martin
      &amp; Co."
    </p>
    <p>
      A stout youth, walking across the office with his hands full of papers,
      stopped in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, John Maude!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, where have you been? The old man's been as mad as a hornet since he
      found you had quit without leave. He was asking for you just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I'm up against it," admitted John cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you go yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John put the thing to him candidly, as man to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here, Spiller, suppose you got up one day and found it was a
      perfectly bully morning, and remembered that the Giants were playing the
      Athletics, and looked at your mail, and saw that someone had sent you a
      pass for the game&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you at the ball-game? You've got the nerve! Didn't you know there
      would be trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old man," said John frankly, "I could no more have turned down that pass&mdash;
      Oh, well, what's the use? It was just great. I suppose I'd better tackle
      the boss now. It's got to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a task to which many would have looked forward. Most of those
      who came into contact with Andrew Westley were afraid of him. He was a
      capable rather than a lovable man, and too self-controlled to be quite
      human. There was no recoil in him, no reaction after anger, as there would
      have been in a hotter-tempered man. He thought before he acted, but, when
      he acted, never yielded a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, in all the years of their connection, had never been able to make
      anything of him. At first, he had been prepared to like him, as he liked
      nearly everybody. But Mr. Westley had discouraged all advances, and, as
      time went by, his nephew had come to look on him as something apart from
      the rest of the world, one of those things which no fellow could
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mr. Westley's side, there was something to be said in extenuation of
      his attitude. John reminded him of his father, and he had hated the late
      Prince of Mervo with a cold hatred that had for a time been the ruling
      passion of his life. He had loved his sister, and her married life had
      been one long torture to him, a torture rendered keener by the fact that
      he was powerless to protect either her happiness or her money. Her money
      was her own, to use as she pleased, and the use which pleased her most was
      to give it to her husband, who could always find a way of spending it. As
      to her happiness, that was equally out of his control. It was bound up in
      her Prince, who, unfortunately, was a bad custodian for it. At last, an
      automobile accident put an end to His Highness's hectic career (and,
      incidentally, to that of a blonde lady from the <i>Folies Bergeres</i>),
      and the Princess had returned to her brother's home, where, a year later,
      she died, leaving him in charge of her infant son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westley's desire from the first had been to eliminate as far as
      possible all memory of the late Prince. He gave John his sister's name,
      Maude, and brought him up as an American, in total ignorance of his
      father's identity. During all the years they had spent together, he had
      never mentioned the Prince's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He disliked John intensely. He fed him, clothed him, sent him to college,
      and gave him a place in his office, but he never for a moment relaxed his
      bleakness of front toward him. John was not unlike his father in
      appearance, though built on a larger scale, and, as time went on, little
      mannerisms, too, began to show themselves, that reminded Mr. Westley of
      the dead man, and killed any beginnings of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, for his part, had the philosophy which goes with perfect health. He
      fitted his uncle into the scheme of things, or, rather, set him outside
      them as an irreconcilable element, and went on his way enjoying life in
      his own good-humored fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only lately, since he had joined the firm, that he had been
      conscious of any great strain. College had given him a glimpse of a larger
      life, and the office cramped him. He felt vaguely that there were bigger
      things in the world which he might be doing. His best friends, of whom he
      now saw little, were all men of adventure and enterprise, who had tried
      their hand at many things; men like Jimmy Pitt, who had done nearly
      everything that could be done before coming into an unexpected
      half-million; men like Rupert Smith, who had been at Harvard with him and
      was now a reporter on the <i>News</i>; men like Baker, Faraday, Williams&mdash;he
      could name half-a-dozen, all men who were <i>doing</i> something, who were
      out on the firing line.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a man who worried. He had not that temperament. But sometimes
      he would wonder in rather a vague way whether he was not allowing life to
      slip by him a little too placidly. An occasional yearning for something
      larger would attack him. There seemed to be something in him that made for
      inaction. His soul was sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been told of the identity of his father, it is possible that he
      might have understood. The Princes of Mervo had never taken readily to
      action and enterprise. For generations back, if they had varied at all,
      son from father, it had been in the color of hair or eyes, not in
      character&mdash;a weak, shiftless procession, with nothing to distinguish
      them from the common run of men except good looks and a talent for wasting
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was the first of the line who had in him the seeds of better things.
      The Westley blood and the bracing nature of his education had done much to
      counteract the Mervo strain. He did not know it, but the American in him
      was winning. The desire for action was growing steadily every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Mervo that had sent him to the polo grounds on the previous
      day. That impulse had been purely Mervian. No prince of that island had
      ever resisted a temptation. But it was America that was sending him now to
      meet his uncle with a quiet unconcern as to the outcome of the interview.
      The spirit of adventure was in him. It was more than possible that Mr.
      Westley would sink the uncle in the employer and dismiss him as summarily
      as he would have dismissed any other clerk in similar circumstances. If
      so, he was prepared to welcome dismissal. Other men fought an unsheltered
      fight with the world, so why not he?
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards the door of the inner office with a certain exhilaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached, it flew open, disclosing Mr. Westley himself, a tall,
      thin man, at the sight of whom Spiller shot into his seat like a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      John went to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Mr. Westley; "come in here. I want to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      John followed him into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down," said his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited while he dictated a letter. Neither spoke till the
      stenographer had left the room. John met the girl's eye as she passed.
      There was a compassionate look in it. John was popular with his fellow
      employes. His absence had been the cause of discussion and speculation
      among them, and the general verdict had been that there would be troublous
      times for him on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed, Mr. Westley leaned back in his chair, and regarded
      his nephew steadily from under a pair of bushy gray eyebrows which lent a
      sort of hypnotic keenness to his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were at the ball-game yesterday?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpectedness of the question startled John into a sharp laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, recovering himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It didn't seem worth while asking for leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that you relied so implicitly on our relationship to save you
      from the consequences?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I meant&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we need not try and discover what you may have meant. What claim do
      you put forward for special consideration? Why should I treat you
      differently from any other member of the staff?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John had a feeling that the interview was being taken at too rapid a pace.
      He felt confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want you to treat me differently," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westley did not reply. John saw that he had taken a check-book from
      its pigeonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we understand each other," said Mr. Westley. "There is no need
      for any discussion. I am writing you a check for ten thousand dollars&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten thousand dollars!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It happens to be your own. It was left to me in trust for you by your
      mother. By a miracle your father did not happen to spend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      John caught the bitter note which the other could not keep out of his
      voice, and made one last attempt to probe this mystery. As a boy he had
      tried more than once before he realized that this was a forbidden topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was my father?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westley blotted the check carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the worst blackguard I ever had the misfortune to know," he replied
      in an even tone. "Will you kindly give me a receipt for this? Then I need
      not detain you. You may return to the ball-game without any further delay.
      Possibly," he went on, "you may wonder why you have not received this
      money before. I persuaded your mother to let me use my discretion in
      choosing the time when it should be handed over to you. I decided to wait
      until, in my opinion, you had sense enough to use it properly. I do not
      think that time has arrived. I do not think it will ever arrive. But as we
      are parting company and shall, I hope, never meet again, you had better
      have it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      John signed the receipt in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Mr. Westley. "Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door John hesitated. He had looked forward to this moment as one of
      excitement and adventure, but now that it had come it had left him in
      anything but an uplifted mood. He was naturally warm-hearted, and his
      uncle's cold anger hurt him. It was so different from anything sudden, so
      essentially not of the moment. He felt instinctively that it had been
      smoldering for a long time, and realized with a shock that his uncle had
      not been merely indifferent to him all these years, but had actually hated
      him. It was as if he had caught a glimpse of something ugly. He felt that
      this was the last scene of some long drawn-out tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something made him turn impulsively back towards the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle&mdash;" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. The hopelessness of attempting any step towards a better
      understanding overwhelmed him. Mr. Westley had begun to write. He must
      have seen John's movement, but he continued to write as if he were alone
      in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      John turned to the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westley did not look up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV &mdash; VIVE LE ROI!
    </h2>
    <p>
      When, an hour later, John landed in New York from the ferry, his mood had
      changed. The sun and the breeze had done their work. He looked on life
      once more with a cheerful and optimistic eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first act, on landing, was to proceed to the office of the <i>News</i>
      and enquire for Rupert Smith. He felt that he had urgent need of a few
      minutes' conversation with him. Now that the painter had been definitely
      cut that bound him to the safe and conventional, and he had set out on his
      own account to lead the life adventurous, he was conscious of an absurd
      diffidence. New York looked different to him. It made him feel positively
      shy. A pressing need for a friendly native in this strange land manifested
      itself. Smith would have ideas and advice to bestow&mdash;he was
      notoriously prolific of both&mdash;and in this crisis both were highly
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith, however, was not at the office. He had gone out, John was informed,
      earlier in the morning to cover a threatened strike somewhere down on the
      East Side. John did not go in search of him. The chance of finding him in
      that maze of mean streets was remote. He decided to go uptown, select a
      hotel, and lunch. To the need for lunch he attributed a certain sinking
      sensation of which he was becoming more and more aware, and which bore
      much too close a resemblance to dismay to be pleasant. The poet's
      statement that "the man who's square, his chances always are best; no
      circumstance can shoot a scare into the contents of his vest," is only
      true within limits. The squarest men, deposited suddenly in New York and
      faced with the prospect of earning his living there, is likely to quail
      for a moment. New York is not like other cities. London greets the
      stranger with a sleepy grunt. Paris giggles. New York howls. A gladiator,
      waiting in the center of the arena while the Colosseum officials fumbled
      with the bolts of the door behind which paced the noisy tiger he was to
      fight, must have had some of the emotions which John experienced during
      his first hour as a masterless man in Gotham.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surface car carried him up Broadway. At Times Square the Astor Hotel
      loomed up on the left. It looked a pretty good hotel to John. He
      dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he decided that he was acclimated. He had secured a
      base of operations in the shape of a room on the seventh floor, his check
      was safely deposited in the hotel bank, and he was half-way through a
      lunch which had caused him already to look on New York not only as the
      finest city in the world, but also, on the whole, as the one city of all
      others in which a young man might make a fortune with the maximum of speed
      and the minimum of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, having telegraphed his address to his uncle in case of mail,
      he took the latter's excellent advice and went to the polo grounds.
      Returning in time to dress, he dined at the hotel, after which he visited
      a near-by theater, and completed a pleasant and strenuous day at one of
      those friendly restaurants where the music is continuous and the waiters
      are apt to burst into song in the intervals of their other duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second attempt to find Smith next morning failed, as the first had done.
      The staff of the News were out of bed and at work ridiculously early, and
      when John called up the office between eleven and twelve o'clock&mdash;nature's
      breakfast-hour&mdash;Smith was again down East, observing the movements of
      those who were about to strike or who had already struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It hardly seemed worth while starting to lay the bed plates of his fortune
      till he had consulted the expert. What would Rockefeller have done? He
      would, John felt certain, have gone to the ball-game.
    </p>
    <p>
      He imitated the great financier.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was while he was smoking a cigar after dinner that night, musing on the
      fortunes of the day's game and, in particular, on the almost criminal
      imbecility of the umpire, that he was dreamily aware that he was being
      "paged." A small boy in uniform was meandering through the room, chanting
      his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gent wants five minutes wit' you," announced the boy, intercepted.
      "Hasn't got no card. Business, he says."
    </p>
    <p>
      This disposed of the idea that Rupert Smith had discovered his retreat.
      John was puzzled. He could not think of another person in New York who
      knew of his presence at the Astor. But it was the unknown that he was in
      search of, and he decided to see the mysterious stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send him along," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy disappeared, and presently John observed him threading his way
      back among the tables, followed by a young man of extraordinary gravity of
      countenance, who was looking about him with an intent gaze through a pair
      of gold-rimmed spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      John got up to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Maude," he said. "Won't you sit down? Have you had dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, yes," said the spectacled young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have a cigar and coffee, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man remained silent until the waiter had filled his cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Crump," he said. "I am Mr. Benjamin Scobell's private
      secretary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" said John. "Snug job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other seemed to miss something in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard of Mr. Scobell?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to my knowledge," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you have lost touch very much with Mervo, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      John stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mervo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounded like some patent medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been instructed," said Mr. Crump solemnly, "to inform Your
      Highness that the Republic has been dissolved, and that your subjects
      offer you the throne of your ancestors."
    </p>
    <p>
      John leaned back in his chair, and looked at the speaker in dumb
      amazement. The thought flashed across him that Mr. Crump had been
      perfectly correct in saying that he had dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attitude appeared to astound Mr. Crump. He goggled through his
      spectacles at John, who was reminded of some rare fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are John Maude? You said you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm John Maude right enough. We're solid on that point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your mother was the only sister of Mr. Andrew Westley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right there, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there is no mistake. I say the Republic&mdash;" He paused, as if
      struck with an idea. "Don't you know?" he said. "Your father&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      John became suddenly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you've got anything to tell me about my father, go right ahead. You'll
      be the only man I've ever met who has said a word about him. Who the deuce
      was he, anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump's face cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand. I had not expected this. You have been kept in ignorance.
      Your father, Mr. Maude, was the late Prince Charles of Mervo."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to astonish John, but this announcement did so. He dropped
      his cigar in a shower of gray ash on to his trousers, and retrieved it
      almost mechanically, his wide-open eyes fixed on the other's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are Prince John of Mervo, and I am here&mdash;" he got into his
      stride as he reached the familiar phrase&mdash;"to inform Your Highness
      that the Republic has been dissolved, and that your subjects offer you the
      throne of your ancestors."
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrid doubt seized John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're stringing me. One of those Indians at the <i>News</i>, Rupert
      Smith, or someone, has put you up to this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump appeared wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Your Highness would glance at these documents&mdash; This is a copy of
      the register of the church in which your mother and father were married."
    </p>
    <p>
      John glanced at the document. It was perfectly lucid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;then it's true!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly true, Your Highness. And I am here to inform&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where the deuce is Mervo? I never heard of the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an island principality in the Mediterranean, Your High&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For goodness' sake, old man, don't keep calling me 'Your Highness.' It
      may be fun to you, but it makes me feel a perfect ass. Let me get into the
      thing gradually."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump felt in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scobell," he said, producing a roll of bills, "entrusted me with
      money to defray any expenses&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      More than any words, this spectacle removed any lingering doubt which John
      might have had as to the possibility of this being some intricate
      practical joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are these for me?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump passed them across to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are a thousand dollars here," he said. "I am also instructed to say
      that you are at liberty to draw further against Mr. Scobell's account at
      the Wall Street office of the European and Asiatic Bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Scobell had been recurring like a <i>leit-motif</i> in Mr.
      Crump's conversation. This suddenly came home to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before we go any further," he said, "let's get one thing clear. Who is
      this Mr. Scobell? How does he get mixed up in this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is the proprietor of the Casino at Mervo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems to be one of those generous, open-handed fellows. Nothing of the
      tight wad about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is deeply interested in Your High&mdash;in your return."
    </p>
    <p>
      John laid the roll of bills beside his coffee cup, and relighted his
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's mighty good of him," he said. "It strikes me, old man, that I am
      not absolutely up-to-date as regards the internal affairs of this
      important little kingdom of mine. How would it be if you were to put me
      next to one or two facts? Start at the beginning and go right on."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Crump had finished a condensed history of Mervo and Mervian
      politics, John smoked in silence for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life, Crump," he said at last, "is certainly speeding up as far as I am
      concerned. Up till now nothing in particular has ever happened to me. A
      couple of days ago I lost my job, was given ten thousand dollars that I
      didn't know existed, and now you tell me I'm a prince. Well, well! These
      are stirring times. When do we start for the old homestead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scobell was exceedingly anxious that we should return by Saturday's
      boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saturday? What, to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it is too soon. You will not be able to settle your affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I can settle my affairs all right. I've only got to pack a grip
      and tip the bell hops. And as Scobell seems to be financing this show,
      perhaps it's up to me to step lively if he wants it. But it's a pity. I
      was just beginning to like this place. There is generally something doing
      along the White Way after twilight, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of Mr. Scobell's secretary broke up unexpectedly into a slow,
      wide smile. His eyes behind their glasses gleamed with a wistful light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee!" he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at him, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crump," he cried. "Crump, I believe you're a sport!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump seemed completely to have forgotten his responsible position as
      secretary to a millionaire and special messenger to a prince. He smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd have liked a day or two in the old burg," he said softly. "I haven't
      been to Rector's since Ponto was a pup."
    </p>
    <p>
      John reached across the table and seized the secretary's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crump," he said, "you <i>are</i> a sport. This is no time for delay. If
      we are to liven up this great city, we must get busy right away. Grab your
      hat, and come along. One doesn't become a prince every day. The occasion
      wants celebrating. Are you with me, Crump, old scout?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing," said the envoy ecstatically.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      At eight o'clock on the following morning, two young men, hatless and a
      little rumpled, but obviously cheerful, entered the Astor Hotel, demanding
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bell boy who met them was addressed by the larger of the two, and asked
      his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Desmond Ryan," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man patted him on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I appoint you, Desmond Ryan," he said, "Grand Hereditary Bell Hop to the
      Court of Mervo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did Prince John formally enter into his kingdom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V &mdash; MR. SCOBELL HAS ANOTHER IDEA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Owing to collaboration between Fate and Mr. Scobell, John's state entry
      into Mervo was an interesting blend between a pageant and a vaudeville
      sketch. The pageant idea was Mr. Scobell's. Fate supplied the vaudeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception at the quay, when the little steamer that plied between
      Marseilles and the island principality gave up its precious freight, was
      not on quite so impressive a scale as might have been given to the monarch
      of a more powerful kingdom; but John was not disappointed. During the
      voyage from New York, in the intervals of seasickness&mdash;for he was a
      poor sailor&mdash;Mr. Crump had supplied him with certain facts about
      Mervo, one of which was that its adult population numbered just under
      thirteen thousand, and this had prepared him for any shortcomings in the
      way of popular demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Mr. Scobell was exceedingly pleased with the scale of
      the reception, which to his mind amounted practically to pomp. The Palace
      Guard, forty strong, lined the quay. Besides these, there were four
      officers, a band, and sixteen mounted carbineers. The rest of the army was
      dotted along the streets. In addition to the military, there was a
      gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians, mainly drawn from fishing
      circles. The majority of these remained stolidly silent throughout, but
      three, more emotional, cheered vigorously as a young man was seen to step
      on to the gangway, carrying a grip, and make for the shore. General
      Poineau, a white-haired warrior with a fierce mustache, strode forward and
      saluted. The Palace Guards presented arms. The band struck up the Mervian
      national anthem. General Poineau, lowering his hand, put on a pair of <i>pince-nez</i>
      and began to unroll an address of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then seen that the young man was Mr. Crump. General Poineau removed
      his glasses and gave an impatient twirl to his mustache. Mr. Scobell, who
      for possibly the first time in his career was not smoking (though, as was
      afterward made manifest, he had the materials on his person), bustled to
      the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's his nibs, Crump?" he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary's reply was swept away in a flood of melody. To the band Mr.
      Crump's face was strange. They had no reason to suppose that he was not
      Prince John, and they acted accordingly. With a rattle of drums they burst
      once more into their spirited rendering of the national anthem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell sawed the air with his arms, but was powerless to dam the
      flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Highness is shaving, sir!" bawled Mr. Crump, depositing his grip on
      the quay and making a trumpet of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shaving!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. I told him he ought to come along, but His Highness said he
      wasn't going to land looking like a tramp comedian."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time General Poineau had explained matters to the band and they
      checked the national anthem abruptly in the middle of a bar, with the
      exception of the cornet player, who continued gallantly by himself till a
      feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him. An awkward stage wait
      followed, which lasted until John was seen crossing the deck, when there
      were more cheers, and General Poineau, resuming his <i>pince-nez</i>,
      brought out the address of welcome again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Mr. Scobell made his presence felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to meet you, Prince," he said, coming forward. "Scobell's my name.
      Shake hands with General Poineau. No, that's wrong. I guess he kisses your
      hand, don't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll swing on him if he does," said John, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell eyed him doubtfully. His Highness did not appear to him to be
      treating the inaugural ceremony with that reserved dignity which we like
      to see in princes on these occasions. Mr. Scobell was a business man. He
      wanted his money's worth. His idea of a Prince of Mervo was something
      statuesquely aloof, something&mdash;he could not express it exactly&mdash;on
      the lines of the illustrations in the Zenda stories in the magazines&mdash;about
      eight feet high and shinily magnificent, something that would give the
      place a tone. That was what he had had in his mind when he sent for John.
      He did not want a cheerful young man in a soft hat and a flannel suit who
      looked as if at any moment he might burst into a college yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Poineau, meanwhile, had embarked on the address of welcome. John
      regarded him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see," he said to Mr. Scobell, "that the gentleman is making a good
      speech, but what is he saying? That is what gets past me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is welcoming Your Highness," said Mr. Crump, the linguist, "in the
      name of the people of Mervo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, I notice, have had the bully good sense to stay in bed. I guess they
      knew that the Boy Orator would do all that was necessary. He hasn't said
      anything about a bite of breakfast, has he? Has his address happened to
      work around to the subject of shredded wheat and shirred eggs yet? That's
      the part that's going to make a hit with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be breakfast at my villa, Your Highness," said Mr. Scobell. "My
      automobile is waiting along there."
    </p>
    <p>
      The General reached his peroration, worked his way through it, and
      finished with a military clash of heels and a salute. The band rattled off
      the national anthem once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what?" said John, turning to Mr. Scobell. "Breakfast?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you'd better say a few words to them, Your Highness; they'll
      expect it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't speak the language, and they can't understand English. The
      thing'll be a stand-off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crump will hand it to 'em. Here, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Line up and shoot His Highness's remarks into 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all very well for you, Crump," said John. "You probably enjoy this
      sort of thing. I don't. I haven't felt such a fool since I sang 'The
      Maiden's Prayer' on Tremont Street when I was joining the frat. Are you
      ready? No, it's no good. I don't know what to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell 'em you're tickled to death," advised Mr. Scobell anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled in a friendly manner at the populace. Then he coughed.
      "Gentlemen," he said&mdash;"and more particularly the sport on my left who
      has just spoken his piece whose name I can't remember&mdash;I thank you
      for the warm welcome you have given me. If it is any satisfaction to you
      to know that it has made me feel like thirty cents, you may have that
      satisfaction. Thirty is a liberal estimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'His Highness is overwhelmed by your loyal welcome. He thanks you
      warmly,'" translated Mr. Crump, tactfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that we shall get along nicely together," continued John. "If you
      are chumps enough to turn out of your comfortable beds at this time of the
      morning simply to see me, you can't be very hard to please. We shall hit
      it off fine."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Crump:</i> "His Highness hopes and believes that he will always
      continue to command the affection of his people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;" John paused. "That's the lot," he said. "The flow of
      inspiration has ceased. The magic fire has gone out. Break it to 'em,
      Crump. For me, breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early portion of the ride Mr. Scobell was silent and
      thoughtful. John's speech had impressed him neither as oratory nor as an
      index to his frame of mind. He had not interrupted him, because he knew
      that none of those present could understand what was being said, and that
      Mr. Crump was to be relied on as an editor. But he had not enjoyed it. He
      did not take the people of Mervo seriously himself, but in the Prince such
      an attitude struck him as unbecoming. Then he cheered up. After all, John
      had given evidence of having a certain amount of what he would have called
      "get-up" in him. For the purposes for which he needed him, a tendency to
      make light of things was not amiss. It was essentially as a performing
      prince that he had engaged John. He wanted him to do unusual things, which
      would make people talk&mdash;aeroplaning was one that occurred to him.
      Perhaps a prince who took a serious view of his position would try to
      raise the people's minds and start reforms and generally be a nuisance.
      John could, at any rate, be relied upon not to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a good cigar, Prince?" he said, cordially, inserting two fingers in
      his vest-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, Mike," said His Highness affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, Mr. Scobell replaced the remains of his cigar between his
      lips, and turned to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, Prince?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you, Prince," said Mr. Scobell, "to help boom this place. That's
      where you come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to ruling and all that," continued Mr. Scobell, "there isn't any to
      do. The place runs itself. Some guy gave it a shove a thousand years ago,
      and it's been rolling along ever since. What I want you to do is the
      picturesque stunts. Get a yacht and catch rare fishes. Whoop it up.
      Entertain swell guys when they come here. Have a Court&mdash;see what I
      mean?&mdash;same as over in England. Go around in aeroplanes and that
      style of thing. Don't worry about money. That'll be all right. You draw
      your steady hundred thousand a year and a good chunk more besides, when we
      begin to get a move on, so the dough proposition doesn't need to scare you
      any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I, by George!" said John. "It seems to me that I've fallen into a
      pretty soft thing here. There'll be a joker in the deck somewhere, I
      guess. There always is in these good things. But I don't see it yet. You
      can count me in all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good boy," said Mr. Scobell. "And now you'll be wanting to get to the
      Palace. I'll have them bring the automobile round."
    </p>
    <p>
      The council of state broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen John off in the car, the financier proceeded to his sister's
      sitting-room. Miss Scobell had breakfasted apart that morning, by request,
      her brother giving her to understand that matters of state, unsuited to
      the ear of a third party, must be discussed at the meal. She was reading
      her <i>New York Herald</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Scobell, "he's come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And just the sort I want. Saw the idea of the thing right away, and is
      ready to go the limit. No nonsense about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he nice-looking, Bennie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. All these Mervo princes have been good-lookers, I hear, and this
      one must be near the top of the list. You'll like him, Marion. All the
      girls will be crazy about him in a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Scobell turned a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married? I never thought of that. But no, I guess he's not. He'd have
      mentioned it. He's not the sort to hush up a thing like that. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short. His green eyes gleamed excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marion!" he cried. "<i>Marion!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen. Gee, this thing is going to be the biggest ever. I gotta new
      idea. It just came to me. Your saying that put it into my head. Do you
      know what I'm going to do? I'm going to cable over to Betty to come right
      along here, and I'm going to have her marry this prince guy. Yes, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Miss Scobell showed signs that her brother's conversation really
      interested her. She laid down her paper, and stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, Betty. Why not? She's a pretty girl. Clever too. The Prince'll be
      lucky to get such a wife, for all his darned ancestors away back to the
      flood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But suppose Betty does not like him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like him? She's gotta like him. Say, can't you make your mind soar, or
      won't you? Can't you see that a thing like this has gotta be fixed
      different from a marriage between&mdash;between a ribbon-counter clerk and
      the girl who takes the money at a twenty-five-cent hash restaurant in
      Flatbush? This is a royal alliance. Do you suppose that when a European
      princess is introduced to the prince she's going to marry, they let her
      say: 'Nothing doing. I don't like the shape of his nose'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a spirited imitation of a European princess objecting to the shape
      of her selected husband's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't very romantic, Bennie," sighed Miss Scobell. She was a confirmed
      reader of the more sentimental class of fiction, and this business-like
      treatment of love's young dream jarred upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's founding a dynasty. Isn't that romantic enough for you? You make me
      tired, Marion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Scobell sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, dear. I suppose you know best. But perhaps the Prince won't
      like Betty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell gave a snort of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marion," he said, "you've got a mind like a chunk of wet dough. Can't you
      understand that the Prince is just as much in my employment as the man who
      scrubs the Casino steps? I'm hiring him to be Prince of Mervo, and his
      first job as Prince of Mervo will be to marry Betty. I'd like to see him
      kick!" He began to pace the room. "By Heck, it's going to make this place
      boom to beat the band. It'll be the biggest kind of advertisement.
      Restoration of Royalty at Mervo. That'll make them take notice by itself.
      Then, biff! right on top of that, Royal Romance&mdash;Prince Weds American
      Girl&mdash;Love at First Sight&mdash;Picturesque Wedding! Gee, we'll wipe
      Monte Carlo clean off the map. We'll have 'em licked to a splinter. We&mdash;It's
      the greatest scheme on earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt you are right, Bennie," said Miss Scobell, "but&mdash;"
      her voice became dreamy again&mdash;"it's not very romantic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shucks!" said the schemer impatiently. "Here, where's a cable form?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI &mdash; YOUNG ADAM CUPID
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a red sandstone rock at the edge of the water, where the island curved
      sharply out into the sea, Prince John of Mervo sat and brooded on first
      causes. For nearly an hour and a half he had been engaged in an earnest
      attempt to trace to its source the acute fit of depression which had come&mdash;apparently
      from nowhere&mdash;to poison his existence that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his seventh day on the island, and he could remember every incident
      of his brief reign. The only thing that eluded him was the recollection of
      the exact point when the shadow of discontent had begun to spread itself
      over his mind. Looking back, it seemed to him that he had done nothing
      during that week but enjoy each new aspect of his position as it was
      introduced to his notice. Yet here he was, sitting on a lonely rock,
      consumed with an unquenchable restlessness, a kind of trapped sensation.
      Exactly when and exactly how Fate, that king of gold-brick men, had
      cheated him he could not say; but he knew, with a certainty that defied
      argument, that there had been sharp practise, and that in an unguarded
      moment he had been induced to part with something of infinite value in
      exchange for a gilded fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery baffled him. He sent his mind back to the first definite entry
      of Mervo into the foreground of his life. He had come up from his
      stateroom on to the deck of the little steamer, and there in the
      pearl-gray of the morning was the island, gradually taking definite shape
      as the pink mists shredded away before the rays of the rising sun. As the
      ship rounded the point where the lighthouse still flashed a needless
      warning from its cluster of jagged rocks, he had had his first view of the
      town, nestling at the foot of the hill, gleaming white against the green,
      with the gold-domed Casino towering in its midst. In all Southern Europe
      there was no view to match it for quiet beauty. For all his thews and
      sinews there was poetry in John, and the sight had stirred him like wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not then that depression had begun, nor was it during the reception
      at the quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days that had followed had been peaceful and amusing. He could not
      detect in any one of them a sign of the approaching shadow. They had been
      lazy days. His duties had been much more simple than he had anticipated.
      He had not known, before he tried it, that it was possible to be a prince
      with so small an expenditure of mental energy. As Mr. Scobell had hinted,
      to all intents and purposes he was a mere ornament. His work began at
      eleven in the morning, and finished as a rule at about a quarter after. At
      the hour named a report of the happenings of the previous day was brought
      to him. When he had read it the state asked no more of him until the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report was made up of such items as "A fisherman named Lesieur called
      Carbineer Ferrier a fool in the market-place at eleven minutes after two
      this afternoon; he has not been arrested, but is being watched," and
      generally gave John a few minutes of mild enjoyment. Certainly he could
      not recollect that it had ever depressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it had been something else that had worked the mischief and in another
      moment the thing stood revealed, beyond all question of doubt. What had
      unsettled him was that unexpected meeting with Betty Silver last night at
      the Casino.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been sitting at the Dutch table. He generally visited the Casino
      after dinner. The light and movement of the place interested him. As a
      rule, he merely strolled through the rooms, watching the play; but last
      night he had slipped into a vacant seat. He had only just settled himself
      when he was aware of a girl standing beside him. He got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you care&mdash;?" he had begun, and then he saw her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had all happened in an instant. Some chord in him, numbed till then,
      had begun to throb. It was as if he had awakened from a dream, or returned
      to consciousness after being stunned. There was something in the sight of
      her, standing there so cool and neat and composed, so typically American,
      a sort of goddess of America, in the heat and stir of the Casino, that
      struck him like a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long was it since he had seen her last? Not more than a couple of
      years. It seemed centuries. It all came back to him. It was during his
      last winter at Harvard that they had met. A college friend of hers had
      been the sister of a college friend of his. They had met several times,
      but he could not recollect having taken any particular notice of her then,
      beyond recognizing that she was certainly pretty. The world had been full
      of pretty American girls then. But now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. And, as he looked, he heard America calling to him.
      Mervo, by the appeal of its novelty, had caused him to forget. But now,
      quite suddenly, he knew that he was homesick&mdash;and it astonished him,
      the readiness with which he had permitted Mr. Crump to lead him away into
      bondage. It seemed incredible that he had not foreseen what must happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love comes to some gently, imperceptibly, creeping in as the tide, through
      unsuspected creeks and inlets, creeps on a sleeping man, until he wakes to
      find himself surrounded. But to others it comes as a wave, breaking on
      them, beating them down, whirling them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so with John. In that instant when their eyes met the miracle must
      have happened. It seemed to him, as he recalled the scene now, that he had
      loved her before he had had time to frame his first remark. It amazed him
      that he could ever have been blind to the fact that he loved her, she was
      so obviously the only girl in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;you don't remember me," he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was flushing a little under his stare, but her eyes were shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember you very well, Mr. Maude," she said with a smile. "I thought I
      knew your shoulders before you turned round. What are you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hush. The <i>croupier</i> had set the ball rolling. A wizened
      little man and two ladies of determined aspect were looking up
      disapprovingly. John realized that he was the only person in the room not
      silent. It was impossible to tell her the story of the change in his
      fortunes in the middle of this crowd. He stopped, and the moment passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball dropped with a rattle. The tension relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you take this seat?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you. I'm not playing. I only just stopped to look on. My aunt
      is in one of the rooms, and I want to make her come home. I'm tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught the eye of the wizened man, and stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been in Mervo long?" he said, as the ball fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only arrived this morning. It seems lovely. I must explore to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to move off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Er&mdash;" John coughed to remove what seemed to him a deposit of sawdust
      and unshelled nuts in his throat. "Er&mdash;may I&mdash;will you let me
      show you&mdash;" prolonged struggle with the nuts and sawdust; then
      rapidly&mdash;"some of the places to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly spoken the words when it was borne in upon him that he was a
      vulgar, pushing bounder, presuming on a dead and buried acquaintanceship
      to force his company on a girl who naturally did not want it, and who
      would now proceed to snub him as he deserved. He quailed. Though he had
      not had time to collect and examine and label his feelings, he was
      sufficiently in touch with them to know that a snub from her would be the
      most terrible thing that could possibly happen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not snub him. Indeed, if he had been in a state of mind coherent
      enough to allow him to observe, he might have detected in her eyes and her
      voice signs of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like it very much," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John made his big effort. He attacked the nuts and sawdust which had come
      back and settled down again in company with a large lump of some
      unidentified material, as if he were bucking center. They broke before him
      as, long ago, the Yale line had done, and his voice rang out as if through
      a megaphone, to the unconcealed disgust of the neighboring gamesters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you go along the path at the foot of the hill," he bellowed rapidly,
      "and follow it down to the sea, you get a little bay full of red sandstone
      rocks&mdash;you can't miss it&mdash;and there's a fine view of the island
      from there. I'd like awfully well to show that to you. It's great."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then shall we meet there?" she said. "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John was in no mood to postpone the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As early as ever you like," he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At about ten, then. Good-night, Mr. Maude."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      John had reached the bay at half-past eight, and had been on guard there
      ever since. It was now past ten, but still there were no signs of Betty.
      His depression increased. He told himself that she had forgotten. Then,
      that she had remembered, but had changed her mind. Then, that she had
      never meant to come at all. He could not decide which of the three
      theories was the most distressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mood became morbidly introspective. He was weighed down by a sense of
      his own unworthiness. He submitted himself to a thorough examination, and
      the conclusion to which he came was that, as an aspirant to the regard, of
      a girl like Betty, he did not score a single point. No wonder she had
      ignored the appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold sweat broke out on him. This was the snub! She had not administered
      it in the Casino simply in order that, by being delayed, its force might
      be the more overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch again, and the world grew black. It was twelve
      minutes after ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, in his time, had thought and read a good deal about love. Ever since
      he had grown up, he had wanted to fall in love. He had imagined love as a
      perpetual exhilaration, something that flooded life with a golden glow as
      if by the pressing of a button or the pulling of a switch, and
      automatically removed from it everything mean and hard and uncomfortable;
      a something that made a man feel grand and god-like, looking down
      (benevolently, of course) on his fellow men as from some lofty mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      That it should make him feel a worm-like humility had not entered his
      calculations. He was beginning to see something of the possibilities of
      love. His tentative excursions into the unknown emotion, while at college,
      had never really deceived him; even at the time a sort of second self had
      looked on and sneered at the poor imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was different. This had nothing to do with moonlight and soft music.
      It was raw and hard. It hurt. It was a thing sharp and jagged, tearing at
      the roots of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head, and looked up the path for the hundredth time, and
      this time he sprang to his feet. Between the pines on the hillside his eye
      had caught the flutter of a white dress.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII &mdash; MR. SCOBELL IS FRANK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Much may happen in these rapid times in the course of an hour and a half.
      While John was keeping his vigil on the sandstone rock, Betty was having
      an interview with Mr. Scobell which was to produce far-reaching results,
      and which, incidentally, was to leave her angrier and more at war with the
      whole of her world than she could remember to have been in the entire
      course of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview began, shortly after breakfast, in a gentle and tactful
      manner, with Aunt Marion at the helm. But Mr. Scobell was not the man to
      stand by silently while persons were being tactful. At the end of the
      second minute he had plunged through his sister's mild monologue like a
      rhinoceros through a cobweb, and had stated definitely, with an economy of
      words, the exact part which Betty was to play in Mervian affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say you want to know why you were cabled for. I'll tell you. There's
      no use talking for half a day before you get to the point. I guess you've
      heard that there's a prince here instead of a republic now? Well, that's
      where you come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean&mdash;?" she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do," said Mr. Scobell. There was a touch of doggedness in his
      voice. He was not going to stand any nonsense, by Heck, but there was no
      doubt that Betty's wide-open eyes were not very easy to meet. He went on
      rapidly. "Cut out any fool notions about romance." Miss Scobell, who was
      knitting a sock, checked her needles for a moment in order to sigh. Her
      brother eyed her morosely, then resumed his remarks. "This is a matter of
      state. That's it. You gotta cut out fool notions and act for good of
      state. You gotta look at it in the proper spirit. Great honor&mdash;see
      what I mean? Princess and all that. Chance of a lifetime&mdash;dynasty&mdash;you
      gotta look at it that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Scobell heaved another sigh, and dropped a stitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the love of Mike," said her brother, irritably, "don't snort like
      that, Marion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had not taken her eyes off him from his first word. An unbiased
      observer would have said that she made a pretty picture, standing there,
      in her white dress, but in the matter of pictures, still life was
      evidently what Mr. Scobell preferred for his gaze never wandered from the
      cigar stump which he had removed from his mouth in order to knock off the
      ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty continued to regard him steadfastly. The shock of his words had to
      some extent numbed her. At this moment she was merely thinking, quite
      dispassionately, what a singularly nasty little man he looked, and
      wondering&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;what strange quality,
      invisible to everybody else, it had been in him that had made her mother
      his adoring slave during the whole of their married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her mind began to work actively once more. She was a Western girl,
      and an insistence on freedom was the first article in her creed. A great
      rush of anger filled her, that this man should set himself up to dictate
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that you want me to marry this Prince?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't do anything of the sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw! Don't be foolish. You make me tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's eye shone mutinously. Her cheeks were flushed, and her slim,
      boyish figure quivered. Her chin, always determined, became a silent
      Declaration of Independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Marion, suspending operations on the sock, went on with tact at the
      point where her brother's interruption had forced her to leave off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure he's a very nice young man. I have not seen him, but everybody
      says so. You like him, Bennie, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, I like him. He's a corker. Wait till you see him, Betty. Nobody's
      asking you to marry him before lunch. You'll have plenty of time to get
      acquainted. It beats me what you're kicking at. You give me a pain in the
      neck. Be reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty sought for arguments to clinch her refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's ridiculous," she said. "You talk as if you had just to wave your
      hand. Why should your prince want to marry a girl he has never seen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will," said Mr. Scobell confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I know he's a sensible young skeesicks. That's how. See here,
      Betty, you've gotten hold of wrong ideas about this place. You don't
      understand the position of affairs. Your aunt didn't till I put her wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He bit my head off, my dear," murmured Miss Scobell, knitting placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're thinking that Mervo is an ordinary state, and that the Prince is
      one of those independent, all-wool, off-with-his-darned-head rulers like
      you read about in the best sellers. Well, you've got another guess coming.
      If you want to know who's the big noise here, it's me&mdash;me! This
      Prince guy is my hired man. See? Who sent for him? I did. Who put him on
      the throne? I did. Who pays him his salary? I do, from the profits of the
      Casino. Now do you understand? He knows his job. He knows which side his
      bread's buttered. When I tell him about this marriage, do you know what
      he'll say? He'll say 'Thank you, sir!' That's how things are in this
      island."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty shuddered. Her face was white with humiliation. She half-raised her
      hands with an impulsive movement to hide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't. I won't. I won't!" she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell was pacing the room in an ecstasy of triumphant rhetoric.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's another thing," he said, swinging round suddenly and causing his
      sister to drop another stitch. "Maybe you think he's some kind of a Dago,
      this guy? Maybe that's what's biting you. Let me tell you that he's an
      American&mdash;pretty near as much an American as you are yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An American!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't believe it, eh? Well, let me tell you that his mother was born and
      raised in Jersey, and that he has lived all his life in the States. He's
      no little runt of a Dago. No, sir. He's a Harvard man, six-foot high and
      weighs two hundred pounds. That's the sort of man he is. I guess that's
      not American enough for you, maybe? No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do shout so, Bennie!" murmured Miss Scobell. "I'm sure there's no
      need."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty uttered a cry. Something had told her who he was, this Harvard man
      who had sold himself. That species of sixth sense which lies undeveloped
      at the back of our minds during the ordinary happenings of life wakes
      sometimes in moments of keen emotion. At its highest, it is prophecy; at
      its lowest, a vague presentiment. It woke in Betty now. There was no
      particular reason why she should have connected her stepfather's words
      with John. The term he had used was an elastic one. Among the visitors to
      the island there were probably several Harvard men. But somehow she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" she cried. "What was his name before he&mdash;when he&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name?" said Mr. Scobell. "John Maude. Maude was his mother's name.
      She was a Miss Westley. Here, where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was walking slowly toward the door. Something in her face checked
      Mr. Scobell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to think," she said quietly. "I'm going out."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In days of old, in the age of legend, omens warned heroes of impending
      doom. But to-day the gods have grown weary, and we rush unsuspecting on
      our fate. No owl hooted, no thunder rolled from the blue sky as John went
      up the path to meet the white dress that gleamed between the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was singing within him. She had come. She had not forgotten, or
      changed her mind, or willfully abandoned him. His mood lightened swiftly.
      Humility vanished. He was not such an outcast, after all. He was someone.
      He was the man Betty Silver had come to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the sight of her face came reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was pale and cold and hard. She did not speak or smile. As she
      drew near she looked at him, and there was that in her look which set a
      chill wind blowing through the world and cast a veil across the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this bleak world they stood silent and motionless while eons rolled
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm late," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      John searched in his brain for words, and came empty away. He shook his
      head dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we sit down?" said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      John indicated silently the sandstone rock on which he had been communing
      with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down. A sense of being preposterously and indecently big obsessed
      John. There seemed no end to him. Wherever he looked, there were hands and
      feet and legs. He was a vast blot on the face of the earth. He glanced out
      of the corner of his eye at Betty. She was gazing out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dived into his brain again. It was absurd! There must be something to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he realized that a worse thing had befallen. He had no voice. It
      had gone. He knew that, try he never so hard to speak, he would not be
      able to utter a word. A nightmare feeling of unreality came upon him. Had
      he ever spoken? Had he ever done anything but sit dumbly on that rock,
      looking at those sea gulls out in the water?
    </p>
    <p>
      He shot another swift glance at Betty, and a thrill went through him.
      There were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment&mdash;the action was almost automatic&mdash;his left hand
      was clasping her right, and he was moving along the rock to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She snatched her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain, ransacked for the third time, yielded a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the confused state of his mind, John found it necessary if he were to
      speak at all, to say the essential thing in the shortest possible way.
      Polished periods are not for the man who is feeling deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He blurted out, huskily, "I love you!" and finding that this was all that
      he could say, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to himself the words, as he spoke them, sounded bald and meaningless.
      To Betty, shaken by her encounter with Mr. Scobell, they sounded
      artificial, as if he were forcing himself to repeat a lesson. They jarred
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!" she said sharply. "Oh, don't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice stabbed him. It could not have stirred him more if she had
      uttered a cry of physical pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't! I know. I've been told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know all about it. My stepfather has just told me. He said&mdash;he
      said you were his&mdash;" she choked&mdash;"his hired man; that he paid
      you to stay here and advertise the Casino. Oh, it's too horrible! That it
      should be you! You, who have been&mdash;you can't understand what you&mdash;have
      been to me&mdash;ever since we met; you couldn't understand. I can't tell
      you&mdash;a sort of help&mdash;something&mdash;something that&mdash;I
      can't put it into words. Only it used to help me just to think of you. It
      was almost impersonal. I didn't mind if I never saw you again. I didn't
      expect ever to see you again. It was just being able to think of you. It
      helped&mdash;you were something I could trust. Something strong&mdash;solid."
      She laughed bitterly. "I suppose I made a hero of you. Girls are fools.
      But it helped me to feel that there was one man alive who&mdash;who put
      his honor above money&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off. John stood motionless, staring at the ground. For the first
      time in his easy-going life he knew shame. Even now he had not grasped to
      the full the purport of her words. The scales were falling from his eyes,
      but as yet he saw but dimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to speak again, in a low, monotonous voice, almost as if she
      were talking to herself. She was looking past him, at the gulls that
      swooped and skimmed above the glittering water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so tired of money&mdash;money&mdash;money. Everything's money. Isn't
      there a man in the world who won't sell himself? I thought that you&mdash;I
      suppose I'm stupid. It's business, I suppose. One expects too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by," she said. "I'm going."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, and went slowly up the path. Still he made no movement. A
      spell seemed to be on him. His eyes never left her as she passed into the
      shadow of the trees. For a moment her white dress stood out clearly. She
      had stopped. With his whole soul he prayed that she would look back. But
      she moved on once more, and was gone. And suddenly a strange weakness came
      upon John. He trembled. The hillside flickered before his eyes for an
      instant, and he clutched at the sandstone rock to steady himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his brain cleared, and he found himself thinking swiftly. He could
      not let her go like this. He must overtake her. He must stop her. He must
      speak to her. He must say&mdash;he did not know what it was that he would
      say&mdash;anything, so that he spoke to her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raced up the path, calling her name. No answer came to his cries. Above
      him lay the hillside, dozing in the noonday sun; below, the Mediterranean,
      sleek and blue, without a ripple. He stood alone in a land of silence and
      sleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII &mdash; AN ULTIMATUM FROM THE THRONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      At half-past twelve that morning business took Mr. Benjamin Scobell to the
      royal Palace. He was not a man who believed in letting the grass grow
      under his feet. He prided himself on his briskness of attack. Every now
      and then Mr. Crump, searching the newspapers, would discover and hand to
      him a paragraph alluding to his "hustling methods." When this happened, he
      would preserve the clipping and carry it about in his vest-pocket with his
      cigars till time and friction wore it away. He liked to think of himself
      as swift and sudden&mdash;the Human Thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this matter of the royal alliance, it was his intention to have at it
      and clear it up at once. Having put his views clearly before Betty, he now
      proposed to lay them with equal clarity before the Prince. There was no
      sense in putting the thing off. The sooner all parties concerned
      understood the position of affairs, the sooner the business would be
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Betty had not received his information with joy did not distress him.
      He had a poor opinion of the feminine intelligence. Girls got their minds
      full of nonsense from reading novels and seeing plays&mdash;like Betty.
      Betty objected to those who were wiser than herself providing a perfectly
      good prince for her to marry. Some fool notion of romance, of course. Not
      that he was angry. He did not blame her any more than the surgeon blames a
      patient for the possession of an unsuitable appendix. There was no animus
      in the matter. Her mind was suffering from foolish ideas, and he was the
      surgeon whose task it was to operate upon it. That was all. One had to
      expect foolishness in women. It was their nature. The only thing to do was
      to tie a rope to them and let them run around till they were tired of it,
      then pull them in. He saw his way to managing Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he anticipate trouble with John. He had taken an estimate of
      John's character, and it did not seem to him likely that it contained
      unsuspected depths. He set John down, as he had told Betty, as a young man
      acute enough to know when he had a good job and sufficiently sensible to
      make concessions in order to retain it. Betty, after the manner of woman,
      might make a fuss before yielding to the inevitable, but from level-headed
      John he looked for placid acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mood, as the automobile whirred its way down the hill toward the town,
      was sunny. He looked on life benevolently and found it good. The view
      appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days. As a rule,
      he was the man of blood and iron who had no time for admiring scenery, but
      to-day he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance. It was certainly a dandy
      little place, this island of his. A vineyard on the right caught his eye.
      He made a mental note to uproot it and run up a hotel in its place.
      Further down the hill, he selected a site for a villa, where the mimosa
      blazed, and another where at present there were a number of utterly
      useless violets. A certain practical element was apt, perhaps, to color
      Mr. Scobell's half-hours with nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the steamboat leaving the harbor on its journey to Marseilles
      gave him another idea. Now that Mervo was a going concern, a real live
      proposition, it was high time that it should have an adequate service of
      boats. The present system of one a day was absurd. He made a note to look
      into the matter. These people wanted waking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the Palace, he was informed that His Highness had gone out
      shortly after breakfast, and had not returned. The majordomo gave the
      information with a tinkle of disapproval in his voice. Before taking up
      his duties at Mervo, he had held a similar position in the household of a
      German prince, where rigid ceremonial obtained, and John's cheerful
      disregard of the formalities frankly shocked him. To take the present case
      for instance: When His Highness of Swartzheim had felt inclined to enjoy
      the air of a morning, it had been a domestic event full of stir and pomp.
      He had not merely crammed a soft hat over his eyes and strolled out with
      his hands in his pockets, but without a word to his household staff as to
      where he was going or when he might be expected to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell received the news equably, and directed his chauffeur to
      return to the villa. He could not have done better, for, on his arrival,
      he was met with the information that His Highness had called to see him
      shortly after he had left, and was now waiting in the morning-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of footsteps came to Mr. Scobell's ears as he approached the
      room. His Highness appeared to be pacing the floor like a caged animal at
      the luncheon hour. The resemblance was heightened by the expression in the
      royal eye as His Highness swung round at the opening of the door and faced
      the financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, say, Prince," said Mr. Scobell, "this is lucky. I been looking for
      you. I just been to the Palace, and the main guy there told me you had
      gone out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. And I met your stepdaughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell was astonished. Fate was certainly smoothing his way if it
      arranged meetings between Betty and the Prince before he had time to do it
      himself. There might be no need for the iron hand after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did?" he said. "Say, how the Heck did you come to do that? What did
      you know about Betty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Silver and I had met before, in America, when I was in college."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell slapped his thigh joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee, it's all working out like a fiction story in the magazines!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it?" said John. "How? And, for the matter of that, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell answered question with question. "Say, Prince, you and Betty
      were pretty good friends in the old days, I guess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't discuss that, if you don't mind," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone annoyed Mr. Scobell. Off came the velvet glove, and the iron hand
      displayed itself. His green eyes glowed dully and the tip of his nose
      wriggled, as was its habit in times of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" he cried, regarding John with disfavor. "Well, I guess!
      Won't discuss it! You gotta discuss it, Your Royal Texas League Highness!
      You want making a head shorter, my bucko. You&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      John's demeanor had become so dangerous that he broke off abruptly, and
      with an unostentatious movement, as of a man strolling carelessly about
      his private sanctum, put himself within easy reach of the door handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then became satirical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe Your Serene, Imperial Two-by-Fourness would care to suggest a
      subject we can discuss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I will," he said between his teeth. "You were talking to Miss Silver
      about me this morning. She told me one or two of the things you said, and
      they opened my eyes. Until I heard them, I had not quite understood my
      position. I do now. You said, among other things, that I was your hired
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't intended for you to hear," said Mr. Scobell, slightly
      mollified, "and Betty shouldn't oughter have handed it to you. I don't
      wonder you feel raw. I wouldn't say that sort of thing to a guy's face.
      Sure, no. Tact's my middle name. But, since you have heard it, well&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't apologize. You were quite right. I was a fool not to see it before.
      No description could have been fairer. You might have said much more. You
      might have added that I was nothing more than a steerer for a gambling
      hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, Prince!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door. A footman entered, bearing, with a detached
      air, as if he disclaimed all responsibility, a letter on a silver tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell slit the envelope, and began to read. As he did so his eyes
      grew round, and his mouth slowly opened till his cigar stump, after
      hanging for a moment from his lower lip, dropped off like an exhausted
      bivalve and rolled along the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince," he gasped, "she's gone. Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone! What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's beaten it. She's half-way to Marseilles by now. Gee, and I saw the
      darned boat going out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is from her. Listen what she says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "<i>By the time you read this I shall be gone. I am going back
   to America as quickly as I can. I am giving this to a boy to
   take to you directly the boat has started. Please do not try
   to bring me back. I would sooner die than marry the Prince.</i>"
</pre>
    <p>
      John started violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell nodded sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what she says. She sure has it in bad for you. What does she mean?
      Seeing you and she are old friends&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand. Why does she say that to you? Why should she think
      that you knew that I had asked her to marry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" cried Mr. Scobell. "You asked her to marry you? And she turned you
      down! Prince, this beats the band. Say, you and I must get together and do
      something. The girl's mad. See here, you aren't wise to what's been
      happening. I been fixing this thing up. I fetched you over here, and then
      I fetched Betty, and I was going to have you two marry. I told Betty all
      about it this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      John cut through his explanations with a sudden sharp cry. A blinding
      blaze of understanding had flashed upon him. It was as if he had been
      groping his way in a dark cavern and had stumbled unexpectedly into
      brilliant sunlight. He understood everything now. Every word that Betty
      had spoken, every gesture that she had made, had become amazingly clear.
      He saw now why she had shrunk back from him, why her eyes had worn that
      look. He dared not face the picture of himself as he must have appeared in
      those eyes, the man whom Mr. Benjamin Scobell's Casino was paying to marry
      her, the hired man earning his wages by speaking words of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of physical sickness came over him. He held to the table for
      support as he had held to the sandstone rock. And then came rage, rage
      such as he had never felt before, rage that he had not thought himself
      capable of feeling. It swept over him in a wave, pouring through his veins
      and blinding him, and he clung to the table till his knuckles whitened
      under the strain, for he knew that he was very near to murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute passed. He walked to the window, and stood there, looking out.
      Vaguely he heard Mr. Scobell's voice at his back, talking on, but the
      words had no meaning for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to think with a curious coolness. His detachment surprised
      him. It was one of those rare moments in a man's life when, from the
      outside, through a breach in that wall of excuses and self-deception which
      he has been at such pains to build, he looks at himself impartially.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight that John saw through the wall was not comforting. It was not a
      heroic soul that, stripped of its defenses, shivered beneath the scrutiny.
      In another mood he would have mended the breach, excusing and extenuating,
      but not now. He looked at himself without pity, and saw himself weak,
      slothful, devoid of all that was clean and fine, and a bitter contempt
      filled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the window, a blaze of color, Mervo smiled up at him, and suddenly
      he found himself loathing its exotic beauty. He felt stifled. This was no
      place for a man. A vision of clean winds and wide spaces came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just then, at the foot of the hill, the dome of the Casino caught the
      sun, and flashed out in a blaze of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung round and faced Mr. Scobell. He had made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The financier was still talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's how it stands, Prince," he was saying, "and it's up to us to
      get busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I intend to," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good boy!" said the financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To begin with, I shall run you out of this place, Mr. Scobell."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is going to be a cleaning-up," John went on. "I've thought it out.
      There will be no more gambling in Mervo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're crazy with the heat!" gasped Mr. Scobell. "Abolish gambling? You
      can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can. That concession of yours isn't worth the paper it's written on.
      The Republic gave it to you. The Republic's finished. If you want to
      conduct a Casino in Mervo, there's only one man who can give you
      permission, and that's myself. The acts of the Republic are not binding on
      me. For a week you have been gambling on this island without a concession
      and now it's going to stop. Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Prince, talk sense." Mr. Scobell's voice was almost tearful. "It's
      you who don't understand. Do, for the love of Mike, come down off the roof
      and talk sense. Do you suppose that these guys here will stand for this?
      Not on your life. Not for a minute. See here. I'm not blaming you. I know
      you don't know what you're saying. But listen here. You must cut out this
      kind of thing. You mustn't get these ideas in your head. You stick to your
      job, and don't butt in on other folks'. Do you know how long you'd stay
      Prince of this joint if you started in to monkey with my Casino? Just
      about long enough to let you pack a collar-stud and a toothbrush into your
      grip. And after that there wouldn't be any more Prince, sonnie. You stick
      to your job and I'll stick to mine. You're a mighty good Prince for all
      that's required of you. You're ornamental, and you've got get-up in you.
      You just keep right on being a good boy, and don't start trying stunts off
      your own beat, and you'll do fine. Don't forget that I'm the big noise
      here. I'm old Grayback from 'way back in Mervo. See! I've only to twiddle
      my fingers and there'll be a revolution and you for the Down-and-Out Club.
      Don't you forget it, sonnie."
    </p>
    <p>
      John shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've said all I have to say. You've had your notice to quit. After
      to-night the Casino is closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't I tell you the people won't stand for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's for them to decide. They may have some self-respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll fire you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. That will prove that they have not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince, talk sense! You can't mean that you'll throw away a hundred
      thousand dollars a year as if it was dirt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is dirt when it's made that way. We needn't discuss it any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Prince!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, say&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been gone several minutes before the financier recovered full
      possession of his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he did, his remarks were brief and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bug-house!" he gasped. "Abso-lutely bug-house!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX &mdash; MERVO CHANGES ITS CONSTITUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Humor, if one looks into it, is principally a matter of retrospect. In
      after years John was wont to look back with amusement on the revolution
      which ejected him from the throne of his ancestors. But at the time its
      mirthfulness did not appeal to him. He was in a frenzy of restlessness. He
      wanted Betty. He wanted to see her and explain. Explanations could not
      restore him to the place he had held in her mind, but at least they would
      show her that he was not the thing he had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mervo had become a prison. He ached for America. But, before he could go,
      this matter of the Casino must be settled. It was obvious that it could
      only be settled in one way. He did not credit his subjects with the
      high-mindedness that puts ideals first and money after. That military and
      civilians alike would rally to a man round Mr. Scobell and the Casino he
      was well aware. But this did not affect his determination to remain till
      the last. If he went now, he would be like a boy who makes a runaway ring
      at the doorbell. Until he should receive formal notice of dismissal, he
      must stay, although every day had forty-eight hours and every hour twice
      its complement of weary minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he waited, chafing, while Mervo examined the situation, turned it over
      in its mind, discussed it, slept upon it, discussed it again, and
      displayed generally that ponderous leisureliness which is the Mervian's
      birthright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the earliest demonstration was not Mervian at all. It came from
      the visitors to the island, and consisted of a deputation of four, headed
      by the wizened little man, who had frowned at John in the Dutch room on
      the occasion of his meeting with Betty, and a stolid individual with a
      bald forehead and a walrus mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the deputation was, from the first, querulous. The wizened man
      had constituted himself spokesman. He introduced the party&mdash;the
      walrus as Colonel Finch, the others as Herr von Mandelbaum and Mr.
      Archer-Cleeve. His own name was Pugh, and the whole party, like the other
      visitors whom they represented, had, it seemed, come to Mervo, at great
      trouble and expense, to patronize the tables, only to find these suddenly,
      without a word of warning, withdrawn from their patronage. And what the
      deputation wished to know was, What did it all mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were amazed, sir&mdash;Your Highness," said Mr. Pugh. "We could not&mdash;we
      cannot&mdash;understand it. The entire thing is a baffling mystery to us.
      We asked the soldiers at the door. They referred us to Mr. Scobell. We
      asked Mr. Scobell. He referred us to you. And now we have come, as the
      representatives of our fellow visitors to this island, to ask Your
      Highness what it means!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a cigar," said John, extending the box. Mr. Pugh waved aside the
      preferred gift impatiently. Not so Herr von Mandelbaum, who slid forward
      after the manner of one in quest of second base and retired with his prize
      to the rear of the little army once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Archer-Cleeve, a young man with carefully parted fair hair and the
      expression of a strayed sheep, contributed a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I say, by Jove, you know, I mean really, you know, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Mr. Archer-Cleeve upon the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have not come here for cigars," said Mr. Pugh. "We have come here,
      Your Highness, for an explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pugh made an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you question my right to rule this massive country as I think best,
      Mr. Pugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a high-handed proceeding," said the wizened little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walrus spoke for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say?" he murmured huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said," repeated Mr. Pugh, raising his voice, "that it was a high-handed
      proceeding, Colonel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The walrus nodded heavily, in assent, with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yah," said Herr von Mandelbaum through the smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at the spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are from England, Mr. Pugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. I am a British citizen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose some enterprising person began to run a gambling hell in
      Piccadilly, would the authorities look on and smile?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is an entirely different matter, sir. You are quibbling. In England
      gambling is forbidden by law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is in Mervo, Mr. Pugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tchah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say?" said the walrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said 'Tchah!' Colonel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" said the walrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because His Highness quibbled."
    </p>
    <p>
      The walrus nodded approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Highness did nothing of the sort," said John. "Gambling is forbidden
      in Mervo for the same reason that it is forbidden in England, because it
      demoralizes the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is absurd, sir. Gambling has been permitted in Mervo for nearly a
      year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not by me, Mr. Pugh. The Republic certainly granted Mr. Scobell a
      concession. But, when I came to the throne, it became necessary for him to
      get a concession from me. I refused it. Hence the closed doors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Archer-Cleeve once more. "But&mdash;" He paused. "Forgotten what I was
      going to say," he said to the room at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Mandelbaum made some remark at the back of his throat, but was
      ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      John spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were a prince, Mr. Pugh, would you find it pleasant to be in the
      pay of a gambling hell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is neither here nor&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, it is, very much. I happen to have some self-respect.
      I've only just found it out, it's true, but it's there all right. I don't
      want to be a prince&mdash;take it from me, it's a much overrated
      profession&mdash;but if I've got to be one, I'll specialize. I won't
      combine it with being a bunco steerer on the side. As long as I am on the
      throne, this high-toned crap-shooting will continue a back number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say?" said the walrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said that, while I am on the throne here, people who feel it necessary
      to chant 'Come, little seven!' must do it elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you," said Mr. Pugh. "Your remarks are absolutely
      unintelligible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. My actions speak for themselves. It doesn't matter how I
      describe it&mdash;what it comes to is that the Casino is closed. You can
      follow that? Mervo is no longer running wide open. The lid is on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let me tell you, sir&mdash;" Mr. Pugh brought a bony fist down with
      a thump on the table&mdash;"that you are playing with fire. Understand me,
      sir, we are not here to threaten. We are a peaceful deputation of
      visitors. But I have observed your people, sir. I have watched them
      narrowly. And let me tell you that you are walking on a volcano. Already
      there are signs of grave discontent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Already!" cried John. "Already's good. I guess they call it going some in
      this infernal country if they can keep awake long enough to take action
      within a year after a thing has happened. I don't know if you have any
      influence with the populace, Mr. Pugh&mdash;you seem a pretty warm and
      important sort of person&mdash;but, if you have, do please ask them as a
      favor to me to get a move on. It's no good saying that I'm walking on a
      volcano. I'm from Missouri. I want to be shown. Let's see this volcano.
      Bring it out and make it trot around."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may jest&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's jesting? I'm not. It's a mighty serious thing for me. I want to get
      away. The only thing that's keeping me in this forsaken place is this
      delay. These people are obviously going to fire me sooner or later. Why on
      earth can't they do it at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say?" said the walrus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may well ask, Colonel," said Mr. Pugh, staring amazed at John. "His
      Highness appears completely to have lost his senses."
    </p>
    <p>
      The walrus looked at John as if expecting some demonstration of practical
      insanity, but, finding him outwardly calm, closed his eyes and nodded
      heavily again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say, don't you know," said Mr. Archer-Cleeve, "it beats me, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire deputation seemed to consider that John's last speech needed
      footnotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was in no mood to supply them. His patience was exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess we'll call this conference finished," he said. "You've been told
      all you came to find out,&mdash;my reason for closing the Casino. If it
      doesn't strike you as a satisfactory reason, that's up to you. Do what you
      like about it. The one thing you may take as a solid fact&mdash;and you
      can spread it around the town as much as ever you please&mdash;is that it
      is closed, and is not going to be reopened while I'm ruler here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputation then withdrew, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the following morning there came a note from Mr. Scobell. It was brief.
      "Come on down before the shooting begins," it ran. John tore it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the same evening that definite hostilities may be said to have
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the Palace and the market-place there was a narrow street of
      flagged stone, which was busy during the early part of the day but
      deserted after sundown. Along this street, at about seven o'clock, John
      was strolling with a cigarette, when he was aware of a man crouching, with
      his back toward him. So absorbed was the man in something which he was
      writing on the stones that he did not hear John's approach, and the
      latter, coming up from behind was enabled to see over his shoulder. In
      large letters of chalk he read the words: <i>"Conspuez le Prince."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      John's knowledge of French was not profound, but he could understand this,
      and it annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked, the man, squatting on his heels, bent forward to touch up
      one of the letters. If he had been deliberately posing, he could not have
      assumed a more convenient attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      John had been a footballer before he was a prince. The temptation was too
      much for him. He drew back his foot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a howl and a thud, and John resumed his stroll. The first gun
      from Fort Sumter had been fired.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Early next morning a window at the rear of the palace was broken by a
      stone, and toward noon one of the soldiers on guard in front of the Casino
      was narrowly missed by an anonymous orange. For Mervo this was practically
      equivalent to the attack on the Bastille, and John, when the report of the
      atrocities was brought to him, became hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the effort seemed temporarily to have exhausted the fury of the mob.
      The rest of that day and the whole of the next passed without sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast on the following morning Mr. Crump paid a visit to the
      Palace. John was glad to see him. The staff of the Palace were loyal, but
      considered as cheery companions, they were handicapped by the fact that
      they spoke no English, while John spoke no French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump was the bearer of another note from Mr. Scobell. This time John
      tore it up unread, and, turning to the secretary, invited him to sit down
      and make himself at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sipping a cocktail and smoking one of John's cigars, Mr. Crump became
      confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a queer business," he said. "Old Ben is chewing pieces out of the
      furniture up there. He's mad clean through. He's losing money all the
      while the people are making up their minds about this thing, and it beats
      him why they're so slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It beats me, too. I don't believe these hook-worm victims ever turned my
      father out. Or, if they did, somebody must have injected radium into them
      first. I'll give them another couple of days, and, if they haven't fixed
      it by then, I'll go, and leave them to do what they like about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go! Do you want to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I want to go! Do you think I like stringing along in this
      musical comedy island? I'm crazy to get back to America. I don't blame
      you, Crump, because it was not your fault, but, by George! if I had known
      what you were letting me in for when you carried me off here, I'd have
      called up the police reserves. Hello! What's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet as the sound of agitated voices came from the other
      side of the door. The next moment it flew open, revealing General Poineau
      and an assorted group of footmen and other domestics. Excitement seemed to
      be in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Poineau rushed forward into the room, and flung his arms above his
      head. Then he dropped them to his side, and shrugged his shoulders,
      finishing in an attitude reminiscent of Plate 6 ("Despair") in "The Home
      Reciter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mon Prince!"</i> he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A perfect avalanche of French burst from the group outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crump!" cried John. "Stand by me, Crump! Get busy! This is where you make
      your big play. Never mind the chorus gentlemen in the passage. Concentrate
      yourself on Poineau. What's he talking about? I believe he's come to tell
      me the people have wakened up. Offer him a cocktail. What's the French for
      corpse-reviver? Get busy, Crump."
    </p>
    <p>
      The general had begun to speak rapidly, with a wealth of gestures. It
      astonished John that Mr. Crump could follow the harangue as apparently he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crump looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says there is a large mob in the market-place. They are talking&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They would be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;of moving in force on the Palace. The Palace Guards have gone over
      to the people. General Poineau urges you to disguise yourself and escape
      while there is time. You will be safe at his villa till the excitement
      subsides, when you can be smuggled over to France during the night&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for mine," said John, shaking his head. "It's mighty good of you,
      General, and I appreciate it, but I can't wait till night. The boat leaves
      for Marseilles in another hour. I'll catch that. I can manage it
      comfortably. I'll go up and pack my grip. Crump, entertain the General
      while I'm gone, will you? I won't be a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he left the room there came through the open window the mutter of a
      crowd. He stopped. General Poineau whipped out his sword, and brought it
      to the salute. John patted him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a sport, General," he said, "but we sha'n't want it. Come along,
      Crump. Come and help me address the multitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      The window of the room looked out on to a square. There was a small
      balcony with a stone parapet. As John stepped out, a howl of rage burst
      from the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      John walked on to the balcony, and stood looking down on them, resting his
      arms on the parapet. The howl was repeated, and from somewhere at the back
      of the crowd came the sharp crack of a rifle, and a shot, the first and
      last of the campaign, clipped a strip of flannel from the collar of his
      coat and splashed against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A broad smile spread over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had studied for a year, he could not have hit on a swifter or more
      effective method of quieting the mob. There was something so engaging and
      friendly in his smile that the howling died away and fists that has been
      shaken unclenched themselves and fell. There was an expectant silence in
      the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      John beckoned to Crump, who came on to the balcony with some reluctance,
      being mistrustful of the unseen sportsman with the rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell 'em it's all right, Crump, and that there's no call for any fuss.
      From their manner I gather that I am no longer needed on this throne. Ask
      them if that's right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A small man, who appeared to be in command of the crowd, stepped forward
      as the secretary finished speaking, and shouted some words which drew a
      murmur of approval from his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants to know," interpreted Mr. Crump, "if you will allow the Casino
      to open again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him no, but add that I shall be tickled to death to abdicate, if
      that's what they want. Speed them up, old man. Tell them to make up their
      minds on the jump, because I want to catch that boat. Don't let them get
      to discussing it, or they'll stand there talking till sunset. Yes or no.
      That's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's surprised silence when Mr. Crump had spoken. The
      Mervian mind was unused to being hustled in this way. Then a voice
      shouted, as it were tentatively, "<i>Vive la Republique!"</i> and at once
      the cry was taken up on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      John beamed down on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," he said. "Bully! I knew you could get a move on as quick
      as anyone else, if you gave your minds to it. This is what I call
      something like a revolution. It's a model to every country in the world.
      But I guess we must close down the entertainment now, or I shall be
      missing the boat. Will you tell them, Crump, that any citizen who cares
      for a drink and a cigar will find it in the Palace. Tell the household
      staff to stand by to pull corks. It's dry work revolutionizing. And now I
      really must be going. I've run it mighty fine. Slip one of these fellows
      down there half a dollar and send him to fetch a cab. I must step lively."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Five minutes later the revolutionists, obviously embarrassed and ill at
      ease, were sheepishly gulping down their refreshment beneath the stony eye
      of the majordomo and his assistants, while upstairs in the state bedroom
      the deposed Prince was whistling "Dixie" and packing the royal pajamas
      into a suitcase.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X &mdash; MRS. OAKLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Betty, when she stepped on board the boat for Marseilles, had had no
      definite plan of action. She had been caught up and swept away by an
      over-mastering desire for escape that left no room in her mind for
      thoughts of the morrow. It was not till the train was roaring its way
      across southern France that she found herself sufficiently composed to
      review her position and make plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not go back. She could not. The words she had used in her letter
      to Mr. Scobell were no melodramatic rhetoric. They were a plain and
      literal statement of the truth. Death would be infinitely preferable to
      life at Mervo on her stepfather's conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, that settled, what then? What was she to do? The gods are
      businesslike. They sell; they do not give. And for what they sell they
      demand a heavy price. We may buy life of them in many ways: with our
      honor, our health, our independence, our happiness, with our brains or
      with our hands. But somehow or other, in whatever currency we may choose
      to pay it, the price must be paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty faced the problem. What had she? What could she give? Her
      independence? That, certainly. She saw now what a mockery that fancied
      independence had been. She had come and gone as she pleased, her path
      smoothed by her stepfather's money, and she had been accustomed to
      consider herself free. She had learned wisdom now, and could understand
      that it was only by sacrificing such artificial independence that she
      could win through to freedom. The world was a market, and the only
      independent people in it were those who had a market value.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was her market value? What could she do? She looked back at her life,
      and saw that she had dabbled. She had a little of most things&mdash;enough
      of nothing. She could sketch a little, play a little, sing a little, write
      a little. Also&mdash;and, as she remembered it, she felt for the first
      time a tremor of hope&mdash;she could use a typewriter reasonably well.
      That one accomplishment stood out in the welter of her thoughts, solid and
      comforting, like a rock in a quicksand. It was something definite,
      something marketable, something of value for which persons paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tremor of hope did not comfort her long. Her mood was critical, and
      she saw that in this, her one accomplishment, she was, as in everything
      else, an amateur. She could not compete against professionals. She closed
      her eyes, and had a momentary vision of those professionals, keen of face,
      leathern of finger, rattling out myriads of words at a dizzy speed. And,
      at that, all her courage suddenly broke; she drooped forlornly, and,
      hiding her face on the cushioned arm-rest, she began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears are the Turkish bath of the soul. Nature never intended woman to
      pass dry-eyed through crises of emotion. A casual stranger, meeting Betty
      on her way to the boat, might have thought that she looked a little
      worried,&mdash;nothing more. The same stranger, if he had happened to
      enter the compartment at this juncture, would have set her down at sight
      as broken-hearted beyond recovery. Yet such is the magic of tears that it
      was at this very moment that Betty was beginning to be conscious of a
      distinct change for the better. Her heart still ached, and to think of
      John even for an instant was to feel the knife turning in the wound, but
      her brain was clear; the panic fear had gone, and she faced the future
      resolutely once more. For she had just remembered the existence of Mrs.
      Oakley.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Only once in her life had Betty met her stepfather's celebrated aunt, and
      the meeting had taken place nearly twelve years ago. The figure that
      remained in her memory was of a pale-eyed, grenadier-like old lady, almost
      entirely surrounded by clocks. It was these clocks that had impressed her
      most. She was too young to be awed by the knowledge that the tall old
      woman who stared at her just like a sandy cat she had once possessed was
      one of the three richest women in the whole wide world. She only
      remembered thinking that the finger which emerged from the plaid shawl and
      prodded her cheek was unpleasantly bony. But the clocks had absorbed her.
      It was as if all the clocks in the world had been gathered together into
      that one room. There had been big clocks, with almost human faces; small,
      perky clocks; clocks of strange shape; and one dingy, medium-sized clock
      in particular which had made her cry out with delight. Her visit had
      chanced to begin shortly before eleven in the morning, and she had not
      been in the room ten minutes before there was a whirring, and the majority
      of the clocks began to announce the hour, each after its own fashion&mdash;some
      with a slow bloom, some with a rapid, bell-like sound. But the
      medium-sized clock, unexpectedly belying its appearance of being nothing
      of particular importance, had performed its task in a way quite distinct
      from the others. It had suddenly produced from its interior a shabby
      little gold man with a trumpet, who had blown eleven little blasts before
      sliding backward into his house and shutting the door after him. Betty had
      waited in rapt silence till he finished, and had then shouted eagerly for
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the beginner at golf may effect a drive surpassing that of the
      expert, so may a child unconsciously eclipse the practised courtier. There
      was no soft side to Mrs. Oakley's character, as thousands of suave
      would-be borrowers had discovered in their time, but there was a soft
      spot. To general praise of her collection of clocks she was impervious; it
      was unique, and she did not require you to tell her so, but exhibit
      admiration for the clock with the little trumpeter, and she melted. It was
      the one oasis of sentiment in the Sahara of her mental outlook, the grain
      of radium in the pitchblende. Years ago it had stood in a little New
      England farmhouse, and a child had clapped her hands and shouted, even as
      Betty had done, when the golden man slid from his hiding-place. Much water
      had flowed beneath the bridge since those days. Many things had happened
      to the child. But she still kept her old love for the trumpeter. The world
      knew nothing of this. The world, if it had known, would have been
      delighted to stand before the clock and admire it volubly, by the day. But
      it had no inkling of the trumpeter's importance, and, when it came to
      visit Mrs. Oakley, was apt to waste its time showering compliments on the
      obvious beauties of the queens of the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty, ignoring these, jumped up and down before the dingy clock,
      demanding further trumpetings, and, turning to Mrs. Oakley, as one
      possessing influence, she was aware of a curious, intent look in the old
      lady's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you like that clock, my dear?" said Mrs. Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! Oh, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you shall have it some day, honey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was probably the only person who had been admitted to that room who
      would not, on the strength of this remark, have steered the conversation
      gently to the subject of a small loan. Instead, she ran to the old lady,
      and kissed her. And, as to what had happened after that, memory was vague.
      There had been some talk, she remembered, of a dollar to buy candy, but it
      had come to nothing, and now that she had grown older and had read the
      frequent paragraphs and anecdotes that appeared in the papers about her
      stepfather's aunt, she could understand why. She knew now what everybody
      knew of Mrs. Oakley&mdash;her history, her eccentricities, and the
      miserliness of which the papers spoke with a satirical lightness that
      seemed somehow but a thin disguise for what was almost admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oakley was one of two children, a son and a daughter, of a Vermont
      farmer. Of her early life no records remain. Her public history begins
      when she was twenty-two and came to New York. After two years' struggling,
      she found a position in the firm of one Redgrave. Those who knew her then
      speak of her as a tall, handsome girl, hard and intensely ambitious. From
      contemporary accounts she seems to have out-Nietzsched Nietzsche.
      Nietzsche's vision stopped short at the superman. Jane Scobell was a
      superwoman. She had all the titanic selfishness and indifference to the
      comfort of others which marks the superman, and, in addition, undeniable
      good looks and a knowledge of the weaknesses of men. Poor Mr. Redgrave had
      not had a chance from the start. She married him within a year. Two years
      later, catching the bulls in an unguarded moment, Mr. Redgrave despoiled
      them of a trifle over three million dollars, and died the same day of an
      apoplectic stroke caused by the excitement of victory. His widow, after a
      tour in Europe, returned to the United States and visited Pittsburg. Any
      sociologist will support the statement that it is difficult, almost
      impossible, for an attractive widow, visiting Pittsburg, not to marry a
      millionaire, even if she is not particularly anxious to do so. If such an
      act is the primary object of her visit, the thing becomes a certainty.
      Groping through the smoke, Jane Redgrave seized and carried off no less a
      quarry than Alexander Baynes Oakley, a widower, whose income was one of
      the seven wonders of the world. In the fullness of time he, too, died, and
      Jane Oakley was left with the sole control of two vast fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not marry again, though it was rumored that it took three
      secretaries, working nine hours a day, to cope with the written proposals,
      and that butler after butler contracted clergyman's sore throat through
      denying admittance to amorous callers. In the ten years after Alexander
      Baynes' death, every impecunious aristocrat in the civilized world must
      have made his dash for the matrimonial pole. But her pale eyes looked them
      over, and dismissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      During those early years she was tempted once or twice to speculation. A
      failure in a cotton deal not only cured her of this taste, but seems to
      have marked the point in her career when her thoughts began to turn to
      parsimony. Until then she had lived in some state, but now, gradually at
      first, then swiftly, she began to cut down her expenses. Now we find her
      in an apartment in West Central Park, next in a Washington Square hotel,
      then in a Harlem flat, and finally&mdash;her last, fixed abiding-place&mdash;in
      a small cottage on Staten Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious life that she led, this woman who could have bought
      kingdoms if she had willed it. A Swedish maid-of-all-work was her only
      companion. By day she would walk in her little garden, or dust, arrange
      and wind up her clocks. At night, she would knit, or read one of the
      frequent reports that arrived at the cottage from charity workers on the
      East Side. Those were her two hobbies, and her only extravagances&mdash;clocks
      and charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her charity had its limitations. In actual money she expended little. She
      was a theoretical philanthropist. She lent her influence, her time, and
      her advice, but seldom her bank balance. Arrange an entertainment for the
      delectation of the poor, and you would find her on the platform, but her
      name would not be on the list of subscribers to the funds. She would
      deliver a lecture on thrift to an audience of factory girls, and she would
      give them a practical example of what she preached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, with all its limitations, her charity was partly genuine. Her mind
      was like a country in the grip of civil war. One-half of her sincerely
      pitied the poor, burned at any story of oppression, and cried "Give!" but
      the other cried "Halt!" and held her back, and between the two she fell.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was to this somewhat unpromising haven of refuge that Betty's mind now
      turned in her trouble. She did not expect great things. She could not have
      said exactly what she did expect. But, at least, the cottage on Staten
      Island offered a resting-place on her journey, even if it could not be the
      journey's end. Her mad dash from Mervo ceased to be objectless. It led
      somewhere.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI &mdash; A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      New York, revisited, had much the same effect on Betty as it had had on
      John during his first morning of independence. As the liner came up the
      bay, and the great buildings stood out against the clear blue of the sky,
      she felt afraid and lonely. That terror which is said to attack immigrants
      on their first sight of the New York sky-line came to her, as she leaned
      on the rail, and with it a feeling of utter misery. By a continual effort
      during the voyage she had kept her thoughts from turning to John, but now
      he rose up insistently before her, and she realized all that had gone out
      of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rebelled against the mad cruelty of the fate which had brought them
      together again. It seemed to her now that she must always have loved him,
      but it had been such a vague, gentle thing, this love, before that last
      meeting&mdash;hardly more than a pleasant accompaniment to her life,
      something to think about in idle moments, a help and a support when things
      were running crosswise. She had been so satisfied with it, so content to
      keep him a mere memory. It seemed so needless and wanton to destroy her
      illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of love as a wild-beast passion, tearing and torturing quite ordinary
      persons like herself, she had always been a little sceptical. The great
      love poems of the world, when she read them, had always left her with the
      feeling that their authors were of different clay from herself and had no
      common meeting ground with her. She had seen her friends fall in love, as
      they called it, and it had been very pretty and charming, but as far
      removed from the frenzies of the poets as an amateur's snapshot of Niagara
      from the cataract itself. Elsa Keith, for instance, was obviously very
      fond and proud of Marvin, but she seemed perfectly placid about it. She
      loved, but she could still spare half an hour for the discussion of a new
      frock. Her soul did not appear to have been revolutionized in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually Betty had come to the conclusion that love, in the full sense of
      the word, was one of the things that did not happen. And now, as if to
      punish her presumption, it had leaped from hiding and seized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing exaggerated or unintelligible in the poets now. They
      ceased to be inhabitants of another world, swayed by curiously complex
      emotions. They were her brothers&mdash;ordinary men with ordinary feelings
      and a strange gift for expressing them. She knew now that it was possible
      to hate the man you loved and to love the man you hated, to ache for the
      sight of someone even while you fled from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take her long to pass the Customs. A small grip constituted her
      entire baggage. Having left this in the keeping of the amiable proprietor
      of a near-by delicatessen store, she made her way to the ferry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first enquiry brought her to the cottage. Mrs. Oakley was a celebrity
      on Staten Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door she paused for a moment, then knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Swede servant, she who had been there at her former visit, twelve
      years ago, received her stolidly. Mrs. Oakley was dusting her clocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask her if she can see me," said Betty. "I'm&mdash;" great step-niece
      sounded too ridiculous&mdash;"I'm her niece," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handmaid went and returned, stolid as ever. "Ay tal her vat yu say
      about niece, and she say she not knowing any niece," she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty amended the description, and presently the Swede returned once more,
      and motioned her to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like so many scenes of childhood, the room of the clocks was sharply
      stamped on Betty's memory, and, as she came into it now, it seemed to her
      that nothing had changed. There were the clocks, all round the walls, of
      every shape and size, the big clocks with the human faces and the small,
      perky clocks. There was the dingy, medium-sized clock that held the
      trumpeter. And there, looking at her with just the old sandy-cat
      expression in her pale eyes, was Mrs. Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the possession of an income of eighteen million dollars and a unique
      collection of clocks cannot place a woman above the making of the obvious
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you have grown!" said Mrs. Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to melt the chill that had gathered around Betty's heart.
      She had been prepared to enter into long explanations, and the knowledge
      that these would not be required was very comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember me?" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the little girl who clapped her hands at the trumpeter, but you
      are not little now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not so very big," said Betty, smiling. She felt curiously at home,
      and pity for the loneliness of this strange old woman caused her to forget
      her own troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look pretty when you smile," said Mrs. Oakley thoughtfully. She
      continued to look closely at her. "You are in trouble," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty met her eyes frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman bent her head over a Sevres china clock, and stroked it
      tenderly with her feather duster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you run away?" she asked without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had a feeling that the ground was being cut from beneath her feet.
      She had expected to have to explain who she was and why she had come, and
      behold, both were unnecessary. It was uncanny. And then the obvious
      explanation occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did my stepfather cable?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oakley laid down the feather duster and, opening a drawer, produced
      some sheets of paper&mdash;to the initiated eye plainly one of Mr.
      Scobell's lengthy messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wickedly extravagant cable," she said, frowning at it. "He could have
      expressed himself perfectly well at a quarter of the expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty began to read. The dimple on her chin appeared for a moment as she
      did so. The tone of the message was so obsequious. There was no trace of
      the old peremptory note in it. The words "dearest aunt" occurred no fewer
      than six times in the course of the essay, its author being apparently
      reckless of the fact that it was costing him half a dollar a time. Mrs.
      Oakley had been quite right in her criticism. The gist of the cable was, "<i>Betty
      has run away to America dearest aunt ridiculous is sure to visit you
      please dearest aunt do not encourage her</i>." The rest was pure padding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oakley watched her with a glowering eye. "If Bennie Scobell," she
      soliloquized, "imagines that he can dictate to me&mdash;" She ceased,
      leaving an impressive hiatus. Unhappy Mr. Scobell, convicted of dictation
      even after three dollars' worth of "dearest aunt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty handed back the cable. Her chin, emblem of war, was tilted and
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you why I ran away, Aunt," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oakley listened to her story in silence. Betty did not relate it at
      great length, for with every word she spoke, the thought of John stabbed
      her afresh. She omitted much that has been told in this chronicle. But she
      disclosed the essential fact, that Napoleonic Mr. Scobell had tried to
      force her into a marriage with a man she did not&mdash;she hesitated at
      the word&mdash;did not respect, she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oakley regarded her inscrutably for a while before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respect!" she said at last. "I have never met a man in my life whom I
      could respect. Harpies! Every one of them! Every one of them! Every one of
      them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was muttering to herself. It is possible that her thoughts were back
      with those persevering young aristocrats of her second widowhood.
      Certainly, if she had sometimes displayed a touch of the pirate in her
      dealings with man, man, it must be said in fairness, had not always shown
      his best side to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respect!" she muttered again. "Did you like him, this Prince of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's eyes filled. She made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, never mind," said Mrs. Oakley. "Don't cry, child! I'm not going to
      press you. You must have hated him or else loved him very much, or you
      would never have run away.... Dictate to me!" she broke off, half-aloud,
      her mind evidently once more on Mr. Scobell's unfortunate cable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty could bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I loved him!" she cried. "I loved him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shaking with dry sobs. She felt the old woman's eyes upon her, but
      she could not stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden whirr cut through the silence. One of the large clocks near the
      door was beginning to strike the hour. Instantly the rest began to do the
      same, till the room was full of the noise. And above the din there sounded
      sharp and clear the note of the little trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise died away with metallic echoings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a changed voice that spoke. Betty looked up, and saw that the eyes
      that met hers were very soft. She moved quickly to the old woman's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honey, I'm going to tell you something about myself that nobody dreams
      of. Betty, when I was your age, <i>I</i> ran away from a man because I
      loved him. It was just a little village tragedy, my dear. I think he was
      fond of me, but father was poor and her folks were the great people of the
      place, and he married her. And I ran away, like you, and went to New
      York."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty pressed her hand. It was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry," she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went to New York because I wanted to kill my heart. And I killed it.
      There's only one way. Work! Work! Work!" She was sitting bolt upright, and
      the soft look had gone out of her eyes. They were hard and fiery under the
      drawn brows. "Work! Ah, I worked! I never rested. For two years. Two whole
      years. It fought back at me. It tore me to bits. But I wouldn't stop. I
      worked on, I killed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, quivering. Betty was cold with a nameless dismay. She felt as
      if she were standing in the dark on the brink of an abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman began to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Child, it's the same with you. Your heart's tearing you. Don't let it! It
      will get worse and worse if you are afraid of it. Fight it! Kill it!
      Work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped again, clenching and unclenching her fingers, as if she were
      strangling some living thing. There was silence for a long moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you do?" she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was calm and unemotional again. The abruptness of the transition
      from passion to the practical took Betty aback. She could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must be something," continued Mrs. Oakley. "When I was your age I
      had taught myself bookkeeping, shorthand, and typewriting. What can you
      do? Can you use a typewriter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Blessed word!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Betty promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "H'm. Well, I expect you will do it well enough for Mr. Renshaw&mdash;on
      my recommendation. I'll give you a letter to him. He is the editor of a
      small weekly paper. I don't know how much he will offer you, but take it
      and <i>work!</i> You'll find him pleasant. I have met him at charity
      organization meetings on the East Side. He's useful at the entertainments&mdash;does
      conjuring tricks&mdash;stupid, but they seem to amuse people. You'll find
      him pleasant. There."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been writing the letter of introduction during the course of these
      remarks. At the last word she blotted it, and placed it in an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the address," she said. "J. Brabazon Renshaw, Office of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>. Take it to him now. Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if she were ashamed of her late display of emotion. She spoke
      abruptly, and her pale eyes were expressionless. Betty thanked her and
      turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me how you get on," said Mrs. Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And <i>work</i>. Keep on working!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary return of her former manner as she spoke the words,
      and Betty wavered. She longed to say something comforting, something that
      would show that she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oakley had taken up the feather duster again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Steena will show you out," she said curtly. And Betty was aware of the
      stolid Swede in the doorway. The interview was plainly at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, Aunt," she said, "and thank you ever so much&mdash;for
      everything."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII &mdash; "PEACEFUL MOMENTS"
    </h2>
    <p>
      The man in the street did not appear to know it, but a great crisis was
      imminent in New York journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything seemed much as usual in the city. The cars ran blithely on
      Broadway. Newsboys shouted their mystic slogan, "Wuxtry!" with
      undiminished vim. Society thronged Fifth Avenue without a furrow on its
      brow. At a thousand street corners a thousand policemen preserved their
      air of massive superiority to the things of this world. Of all the four
      million not one showed the least sign of perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the crisis was at hand. Mr. J. Brabazon Renshaw,
      Editor-in-chief of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, was about to leave his post
      and start on a three-months' vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, as its name (an inspiration of Mr. Renshaw's own)
      was designed to imply, was a journal of the home. It was the sort of paper
      which the father of the family is expected to take back with him from the
      office and read aloud to the chicks before bedtime under the shade of the
      rubber plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circumstances had left the development of the paper almost entirely to Mr.
      Renshaw. Its contents were varied. There was a "Moments in the Nursery"
      page, conducted by Luella Granville Waterman and devoted mainly to
      anecdotes of the family canary, by Jane (aged six), and similar works of
      the younger set. There was a "Moments of Meditation" page, conducted by
      the Reverend Edwin T. Philpotts; a "Moments among the Masters" page,
      consisting of assorted chunks looted from the literature of the past, when
      foreheads were bulged and thoughts profound, by Mr. Renshaw himself; one
      or two other special pages; a short story; answers to correspondents on
      domestic matters; and a "Moments of Mirth" page, conducted by one B.
      Henderson Asher&mdash;a very painful affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor of this admirable journal was that Napoleon of finance, Mr.
      Benjamin Scobell.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this should have been so is but one proof of the many-sidedness of
      that great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell had founded <i>Peaceful Moments</i> at an early stage in his
      career, and it was only at very rare intervals nowadays that he
      recollected that he still owned it. He had so many irons in the fire now
      that he had no time to waste his brain tissues thinking about a paper like
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. It was one of his failures. It certainly paid its
      way and brought him a small sum each year, but to him it was a failure, a
      bombshell that had fizzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had intended to do big things with <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. He had
      meant to start a new epoch in the literature of Manhattan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gottan idea," he had said to Miss Scobell. "All this yellow journalism&mdash;red
      blood and all that&mdash;folks are tired of it. They want something
      milder. Wholesome, see what I mean? There's money in it. Guys make a roll
      too big to lift by selling soft drinks, don't they? Well, I'm going to run
      a soft-drink paper. See?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The enterprise had started well. To begin with, he had found the ideal
      editor. He had met Mr. Renshaw at a down-East gathering presided over by
      Mrs. Oakley, and his Napoleonic eye had seen in J. Brabazon the seeds of
      domestic greatness. Before they parted, he had come to terms with him. Nor
      had the latter failed to justify his intuition. He made an admirable
      editor. It was not Mr. Renshaw's fault that the new paper had failed to
      electrify America. It was the public on whom the responsibility for the
      failure must be laid. They spoiled the whole thing. Certain of the
      faithful subscribed, it is true, and continued to subscribe, but the great
      heart of the public remained untouched. The great heart of the public
      declined to be interested in the meditations of Mr. Philpotts and the
      humor of Mr. B. Henderson Asher, and continued to spend its money along
      the bad old channels. The thing began to bore Mr. Scobell. He left the
      conduct of the journal more and more to Mr. Renshaw, until finally&mdash;it
      was just after the idea for extracting gold from sea water had struck him&mdash;he
      put the whole business definitely out of his mind. (His actual words were
      that he never wanted to see or hear of the darned thing again, inasmuch as
      it gave him a pain in the neck.) Mr. Renshaw was given a free hand as to
      the editing, and all matters of finance connected with the enterprise were
      placed in the hands of Mr. Scobell's solicitors, who had instructions to
      sell the journal, if, as its owner crisply put it, they could find any
      chump who was enough of a darned chump to give real money for it. Up to
      the present the great army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal
      standard of darned chumphood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since this parting of the ways, Mr. Renshaw had been in his element.
      Under his guidance <i>Peaceful Moments</i> had reached a level of
      domesticity which made other so-called domestic journals look like
      sporting supplements. But at last the work had told upon him. Whether it
      was the effort of digging into the literature of the past every week, or
      the strain of reading B. Henderson Asher's "Moments of Mirth" is
      uncertain. At any rate, his labors had ended in wrecking his health to
      such an extent that the doctor had ordered him three months' complete
      rest, in the woods or mountains, whichever he preferred; and, being a
      farseeing man, who went to the root of things, had absolutely declined to
      consent to Mr. Renshaw's suggestion that he keep in touch with the paper
      during his vacation. He was adamant. He had seen copies of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> once or twice, and refused to permit a man in Mr. Renshaw's
      state of health to come in contact with Luella Granville Waterman's
      "Moments in the Nursery" and B. Henderson Asher's "Moments of Mirth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must forget that such a paper exists," he said. "You must dismiss the
      whole thing from your mind, live in the open, and develop some flesh and
      muscle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw had bowed before the sentence, howbeit gloomily, and now, on
      the morning of Betty's departure from Mrs. Oakley's house with the letter
      of introduction, was giving his final instructions to his temporary
      successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This temporary successor in the editorship was none other than John's
      friend, Rupert Smith, late of the <i>News</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith, on leaving Harvard, had been attracted by newspaper work, and had
      found his first billet on a Western journal of the type whose society
      column consists of such items as "Jim Thompson was to town yesterday with
      a bunch of other cheap skates. We take this opportunity of once more
      informing Jim that he is a liar and a skunk," and whose editor works with
      a pistol on his desk and another in his hip-pocket. Graduating from this,
      he had proceeded to a reporter's post on a daily paper in Kentucky, where
      there were blood feuds and other Southern devices for preventing life from
      becoming dull. All this was good, but even while he enjoyed these
      experiences, New York, the magnet, had been tugging at him, and at last,
      after two eventful years on the Kentucky paper, he had come East, and
      eventually won through to the staff of the <i>News</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His presence in the office of <i>Peaceful Moments</i> was due to the
      uncomfortable habit of most of the New York daily papers of cutting down
      their staff of reporters during the summer. The dismissed had, to sustain
      them, the knowledge that they would return, like the swallows, anon, and
      be received back into their old places; but in the meantime they suffered
      the inconvenience of having to support themselves as best they could.
      Smith, when, in the company of half-a-dozen others, he had had to leave
      the <i>News</i>, had heard of the vacant post of assistant editor on <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>, and had applied for and received it. Whereby he was more
      fortunate than some of his late colleagues; though, as the character of
      his new work unrolled itself before him, he was frequently doubtful on
      that point. For the atmosphere of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, however
      wholesome, was certainly not exciting, and his happened to be essentially
      a nature that needed the stimulus of excitement. Even in Park Row, the
      denizens of which street are rarely slaves to the conventional and safe,
      he had a well-established reputation in this matter. Others of his
      acquaintances welcomed excitement when it came to them in the course of
      the day's work, but it was Smith's practise to go in search of it. He was
      a young man of spirit and resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appearance, to those who did not know him, hardly suggested this. He
      was very tall and thin, with a dark, solemn face. He was a purist in the
      matter of clothes, and even in times of storm and stress presented an
      immaculate appearance to the world. In his left eye, attached to a cord,
      he wore a monocle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this, at the present moment, he was gazing benevolently at Mr.
      Renshaw, as the latter fussed about the office in the throes of departure.
      To the editor's rapid fire of advice and warning he listened with the
      pleased and indulgent air of a father whose infant son frisks before him.
      Mr. Renshaw interested him. To Smith's mind Mr. Renshaw, put him in any
      show you pleased, would alone have been worth the price of admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," chirruped the holiday-maker&mdash;he was a little man with a long
      neck, and he always chirruped&mdash;"Well, I think that is all, Mr. Smith.
      Oh, ah, yes! The stenographer. You will need a new stenographer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Peaceful Moments</i> stenographer had resigned her position three
      days before, in order to get married.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably, Comrade Renshaw," said Smith. "A blonde."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw looked annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told you before, Mr. Smith, I object to your addressing me as
      Comrade. It is not&mdash;it is not&mdash;er&mdash;fitting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith waved a deprecating hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say no more," he said. "I will correct the habit. I have been studying
      the principles of Socialism somewhat deeply of late, and I came to the
      conclusion that I must join the cause. It looked good to me. You work for
      the equal distribution of property, and start in by swiping all you can
      and sitting on it. A noble scheme. Me for it. But I am interrupting you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw had to pause for a moment to reorganize his ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think&mdash;ah, yes. I think it would be best perhaps to wait for a day
      or two in case Mrs. Oakley should recommend someone. I mentioned the
      vacancy in the office to her, and she said she would give the matter her
      attention. I should prefer, if possible, to give the place to her nominee.
      She&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;has eighteen million a year," said Smith. "I understand. Scatter
      seeds of kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw looked at him sharply. Smith's face was solemn and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind," the editor said, after a pause. "I should prefer
      Mrs. Oakley's nominee because Mrs. Oakley is a shrewd, practical woman who&mdash;er&mdash;who&mdash;who,
      in fact&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so," said Smith, eying him gravely through the monocle. "Entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      The scrutiny irritated Mr. Renshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do put that thing away, Mr. Smith," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that ridiculous glass. Put it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instantly," said Smith, replacing the monocle in his vest-pocket. "You
      object to it? Well, well, many people do. We all have these curious likes
      and dislikes. It is these clashings of personal taste which constitute
      what we call life. Yes. You were saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw wrinkled his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have forgotten what I intended to say," he said querulously. "You have
      driven it out of my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith clicked his tongue sympathetically. Mr. Renshaw looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," he said, "I must be going. I shall miss my train. But I think I
      have covered the ground quite thoroughly. You understand everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely," said Smith. "I look on myself as some engineer controlling a
      machine with a light hand on the throttle. Or like some faithful hound
      whose master&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! There is just one thing. Mrs. Julia Burdett Parslow is a little
      inclined to be unpunctual with her 'Moments with Budding Girlhood.' If
      this should happen while I am away, just write her a letter, quite a
      pleasant letter, you understand, pointing out the necessity of being in
      good time. She must realize that we are a machine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," murmured Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The machinery of the paper cannot run smoothly unless contributors are in
      good time with their copy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," said Smith. "They are the janitors of the literary world. Let
      them turn off the steam heat, and where are we? If Mrs. Julia Burdett
      Parslow is not up to time with the hot air, how shall our 'Girlhood'
      escape being nipped in the bud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is just one other thing. I wish you would correct a slight
      tendency I have noticed lately in Mr. Asher to be just a trifle&mdash;well,
      not precisely risky, but perhaps a shade broad in his humor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young blood!" sighed Smith. "Young blood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Asher is a very sensible man, and he will understand. Well, that is
      all, I think. Now, I really must be going. Good-by, Mr. Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door Mr. Renshaw paused with the air of an exile bidding farewell
      to his native land, sighed and trotted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith put his feet upon the table, flicked a speck of dust from his
      coat-sleeve, and resumed his task of reading the proofs of Luella
      Granville Waterman's "Moments in the Nursery."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      He had not been working long, when Pugsy Maloney, the office boy, entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" said Pugsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say on, Comrade Maloney."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dere's a loidy out dere wit a letter for Mr. Renshaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you acquainted her with the fact that Mr. Renshaw has passed to
      other climes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, in the course of your conversation with this lady, mentioned
      that Mr. Renshaw has beaten it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, I did. And she says can she see you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith removed his feet from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," he said. "Who am I that I should deny people these little
      treats? Ask her to come in, Comrade Maloney."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII &mdash; BETTY MAKES A FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Betty had appealed to Master Maloney's esthetic sense of beauty directly
      she appeared before him. It was with regret, therefore, rather than with
      the usual calm triumph of the office boy, that he informed her that the
      editor was not in. Also, seeing that she was evidently perturbed by the
      information, he had gone out of his way to suggest that she lay her
      business, whatever it might be, before Mr. Renshaw's temporary successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith received her with Old-World courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you sit down?" he said. "Not to wait for Comrade Renshaw, of course.
      He will not be back for another three months. Perhaps I can help you. I am
      acting editor. The work is not light," he added gratuitously. "Sometimes
      the cry goes round New York, 'Can Smith get through it all? Will his
      strength support his unquenchable spirit?' But I stagger on. I do not
      repine. What was it that you wished to see Comrade Renshaw about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung his monocle lightly by its cord. For the first time since she had
      entered the office Betty was rather glad that Mr. Renshaw was away.
      Conscious of her defects as a stenographer she had been looking forward
      somewhat apprehensively to the interview with her prospective employer.
      But this long, solemn youth put her at her ease. His manner suggested in
      some indefinable way that the whole thing was a sort of round game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came about the typewriting," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith looked at her with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you the nominee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you come from Mrs. Oakley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then all is well. The decks have been cleared against your coming.
      Consider yourself engaged as our official typist. By the way, <i>can</i>
      you type?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty laughed. This was certainly not the awkward interview she had been
      picturing in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said, "but I'm afraid I'm not very good at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," said Smith. "I'm not very good at editing. Yet here I am. I
      foresee that we shall make an ideal team. Together, we will toil early and
      late till we whoop up this domestic journal into a shining model of what a
      domestic journal should be. What that is, at present, I do not exactly
      know. Excursion trains will be run from the Middle West to see this
      domestic journal. Visitors from Oshkosh will do it before going on to
      Grant's tomb. What exactly is your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty hesitated. Yes, perhaps it would be better. "Brown," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is Smith. The smiling child in the outer office is Pugsy Maloney,
      one of our most prominent citizens. Homely in appearance, perhaps, but one
      of us. You will get to like Comrade Maloney. And now, to touch on a
      painful subject&mdash;work. Would you care to start in now, or have you
      any other engagements? Perhaps you wish to see the sights of this
      beautiful little city before beginning? You would prefer to start in now?
      Excellent. You could not have come at a more suitable time, for I was on
      the very point of sallying out to purchase about twenty-five cents' worth
      of lunch. We editors, Comrade Brown, find that our tissues need constant
      restoration, such is the strenuous nature of our duties. You will find one
      or two letters on that table. Good-by, then, for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his hat, smoothed it carefully and with a courtly inclination
      of his head, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty sat down, and began to think. So she was really earning her own
      living! It was a stimulating thought. She felt a little bewildered. She
      had imagined something so different. Mrs. Oakley had certainly said that
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i> was a small paper, but despite that, her
      imagination had conjured up visions of bustle and activity, and a
      peremptory, overdriven editor, snapping out words of command. Smith, with
      his careful speech and general air of calm detachment from the noisy side
      of life, created an atmosphere of restfulness. If this was a sample of
      life in the office, she thought, the paper had been well named. She felt
      soothed and almost happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interesting and exciting things, New York things, began to happen at once.
      To her, meditating, there entered Pugsy Maloney, the guardian of the gate
      of this shrine of Peace, a nonchalant youth of about fifteen, with a
      freckled, mask-like face, the expression of which never varied, bearing in
      his arms a cat. The cat was struggling violently, but he appeared quite
      unconscious of it. Its existence did not seem to occur to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" said Pugsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was fond of cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't hurt her!" she cried anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Maloney eyed the cat as if he were seeing it for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't hoitin' her," he said, without emotion. "Dere was two fresh kids
      in the street sickin' a dawg on to her. And I comes up and says, 'G'wan!
      What do youse t'ink youse doin', fussin' de poor dumb animal?' An' one of
      de guys, he says, 'G'wan! Who do youse t'ink youse is?' An' I says, 'I'm
      de guy what's goin' to swat youse on de coco, smarty, if youse don't quit
      fussin' de poor dumb animal.' So wit' dat he makes a break at swattin' me
      one, but I swats him one, an' I swats de odder feller one, an' den I swats
      dem bote some more, an' I gits de kitty, an' I brings her in here, cos I
      t'inks maybe youse'll look after her. I can't be boddered myself. Cats is
      foolishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, having finished this Homeric narrative, Master Maloney fixed an
      expressionless eye on the ceiling, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How splendid of you, Pugsy!" cried Betty. "She might have been killed,
      poor thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She had it pretty fierce," admitted Master Maloney, gazing
      dispassionately at the rescued animal, which had escaped from his clutch
      and taken up a strong position on an upper shelf of the bookcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you go out and get her some milk, Pugsy? She's probably starving.
      Here's a quarter. Will you keep the change?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing," assented Master Maloney.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled slowly out, while Betty, mounting a chair, proceeded to
      chirrup and snap her fingers in the effort to establish the foundations of
      an <i>entente cordiale</i> with the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Pugsy returned, carrying a five-cent bottle of milk, the
      animal had vacated the shelf, and was sitting on the table, polishing her
      face. The milk having been poured into the lid of a tobacco tin, in lieu
      of a saucer, she suspended her operations and adjourned for refreshments,
      Pugsy, having no immediate duties on hand, concentrated himself on the
      cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat kitty. Pipe de leather collar she's wearin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather collar
      encircled the animal's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess I know where dat kitty belongs. Dey all has dose collars. I guess
      she's one of Bat Jarvis's kitties. He's got twenty-t'ree of dem, and dey
      all has dose collars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bat Jarvis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy looked at her incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say! Ain't youse never heard of Bat Jarvis? He's&mdash;he's Bat Jarvis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, I knows him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he live near here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, he lives near here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think the best thing for you to do is to run round and tell him
      that I am taking care of his cat, and that he had better come and fetch
      it. I must be getting on with my work, or I shall never finish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She settled down to type the letters Smith had indicated. She attacked her
      task cautiously. She was one of those typists who are at their best when
      they do not have to hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was putting the finishing touches to the last of the batch, when there
      was a shuffling of feet in the outer room, followed by a knock on the
      door. The next moment there entered a short, burly young man, around whom
      there hung, like an aroma, an indescribable air of toughness, partly due,
      perhaps, to the fact that he wore his hair in a well-oiled fringe almost
      down to his eyebrows, thus presenting the appearance of having no forehead
      at all. His eyes were small and set close together. His mouth was wide,
      his jaw prominent. Not, in short, the sort of man you would have picked
      out on sight as a model citizen. He blinked furtively, as his eyes met
      Betty's, and looked round the room. His face lighted up as he saw the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" he said, stepping forward, and touching the cat's collar. "Ma'am,
      mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you Mr. Jarvis?" asked Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor nodded, not without a touch of complacency, as of a monarch
      abandoning his incognito.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mr. Jarvis was a celebrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      By profession he was a dealer in animals, birds, and snakes. He had a
      fancier's shop on Groome Street, in the heart of the Bowery. This was on
      the ground floor. His living abode was in the upper story of that house,
      and it was there that he kept the twenty-three cats whose necks were
      adorned with leather collars.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not the fact that he possessed twenty-three cats with leather
      collars that had made Mr. Jarvis a celebrity. A man may win a local
      reputation, if only for eccentricity, by such means. Mr. Jarvis'
      reputation was far from being purely local. Broadway knew him, and the
      Tenderloin. Tammany Hall knew him. Long Island City knew him. For Bat
      Jarvis was the leader of the famous Groome Street Gang, the largest and
      most influential of the four big gangs of the East Side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Betty, so little does the world often know of its greatest men, he was
      merely a decidedly repellent-looking young man in unbecoming clothes. But
      his evident affection for the cat gave her a feeling of fellowship toward
      him. She beamed upon him, and Mr. Jarvis, who was wont to face the glare
      of rivals without flinching, avoided her eye and shuffled with
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so glad she's safe!" said Betty. "There were two boys teasing her in
      the street. I've been giving her some milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis nodded, with his eyes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Then he looked up, and, fixing his gaze some three feet
      above her head, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" he said, and paused again. Betty waited expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He relaxed into silence again, apparently thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" he said. "Ma'am, obliged. Fond of de kit. I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a dear," said Betty, tickling the cat under the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am," went on Mr. Jarvis, pursuing his theme, "obliged. Sha'n't fergit
      it. Any time you're in bad, glad to be of service. Bat Jarvis. Groome
      Street. Anybody'll show youse where I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and shuffled his feet; then, tucking the cat more firmly under
      his arm, left the room. Betty heard him shuffling downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly gone, when the door opened again, and Smith came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you have had company while I was away?" he said. "Who was the grandee
      with the cat? An old childhood's friend? Was he trying to sell the animal
      to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was Mr. Bat Jarvis," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith looked interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bat! What was he doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty related the story of the cat. Smith nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "I don't know that Comrade Jarvis is precisely the sort
      of friend I would go out of my way to select. Still, you never know what
      might happen. He might come in useful. And now, let us concentrate
      ourselves tensely on this very entertaining little journal of ours, and
      see if we cannot stagger humanity with it."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV &mdash; A CHANGE OF POLICY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The feeling of tranquillity which had come to Betty on her first
      acquaintance with <i>Peaceful Moments</i> seemed to deepen as the days
      went by, and with each day she found the sharp pain at her heart less
      vehement. It was still there, but it was dulled. The novelty of her life
      and surroundings kept it in check. New York is an egotist. It will suffer
      no divided attention. "Look at me!" says the voice of the city
      imperiously, and its children obey. It snatches their thoughts from their
      inner griefs, and concentrates them on the pageant that rolls unceasingly
      from one end of the island to the other. One may despair in New York, but
      it is difficult to brood on the past; for New York is the City of the
      Present, the City of Things that are Going On.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Betty everything was new and strange. Her previous acquaintance with
      the metropolis had not been extensive. Mr. Scobell's home&mdash;or,
      rather, the house which he owned in America&mdash;was on the outskirts of
      Philadelphia, and it was there that she had lived when she was not paying
      visits. Occasionally, during horse-show week, or at some other time of
      festivity, she had spent a few days with friends who lived in Madison or
      upper Fifth Avenue, but beyond that, New York was a closed book to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a miracle in the circumstances, if John and Mervo and
      the whole of the events since the arrival of the great cable had not to
      some extent become a little dream-like. When she was alone at night, and
      had leisure to think, the dream became a reality once more; but in her
      hours of work, or what passed for work in the office of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>, and in the hours she spent walking about the streets and
      observing the ways of this new world of hers, it faded. Everything was so
      bright and busy! Every moment had its fresh interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, above all, there was the sense of adventure. She was twenty-four; she
      had health and an imagination; and almost unconsciously she was stimulated
      by the thrill of being for the first time in her life genuinely at large.
      The child's love of hiding dies hard in us. To Betty, to walk abroad in
      New York in the midst of hurrying crowds, just Betty Brown&mdash;one of
      four million and no longer the beautiful Miss Silver of the society
      column, was to taste the romance of disguise, or invisibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      During office hours she came near to complete contentment. To an expert
      stenographer the amount of work to be done would have seemed ridiculously
      small, but Betty, who liked plenty of time for a task, generally managed
      to make it last comfortably through the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was partly owing to the fact that her editor, when not actually at
      work himself, was accustomed to engage her in conversation, and to keep
      her so engaged until the entrance of Pugsy Maloney heralded the arrival of
      some caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty liked Smith. His odd ways, his conversation, and his extreme
      solicitude for his clothes amused her. She found his outlook on life
      refreshing. Smith was an optimist. Whatever cataclysm might occur, he
      never doubted for a moment that he would be comfortably on the summit of
      the debris when all was over. He amazed Betty with his stories of his
      reportorial adventures. He told them for the most part as humorous stories
      at his own expense, but the fact remained that in a considerable
      proportion of them he had only escaped a sudden and violent death by
      adroitness or pure good luck. His conversation opened up a new world to
      Betty. She began to see that in America, and especially in New York,
      anything may happen to anybody. She looked on Smith with new eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely all this," she said one morning, after he had come to the end
      of the story of a highly delicate piece of interviewing work in connection
      with some Cumberland Mountains feudists, "surely all this&mdash;" She
      looked round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Domesticity?" suggested Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Betty. "Surely it all seems rather tame to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brown," he said, "you have touched the spot with an unerring
      finger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Mr. Renshaw's departure, the flatness of life had come home to Smith
      with renewed emphasis. Before, there had always been the quiet
      entertainment of watching the editor at work, but now he was feeling
      restless. Like John at Mervo, he was practically nothing but an ornament.
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, like Mervo, had been set rolling and had
      continued to roll on almost automatically. The staff of regular
      contributors sent in their various pages. There was nothing for the man in
      charge to do. Mr. Renshaw had been one of those men who have a genius for
      being as busy over nothing as if it were some colossal work, but Smith had
      not that gift. He liked something that he could grip and that gripped him.
      He was becoming desperately bored. He felt like a marooned sailor on a
      barren rock of domesticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visitor who called at the office at this time did nothing to remove this
      sensation of being outside everything that made life worth living. Betty,
      returning to the office one afternoon, found Smith in the doorway, just
      parting from a thickset young man. There was a rather gloomy expression on
      the thickset young man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith, too, she noted, when they were back in the inner office, seemed to
      have something on his mind. He was strangely silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brown," he said at last, "I wish this little journal of ours had
      a sporting page."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Less ribaldry," protested Smith pained. "This is a sad affair. You saw
      the man I was talking to? That was Kid Brady. I used to know him when I
      was out West. He wants to fight anyone in the country at a hundred and
      thirty-three pounds. We all have our hobbies. That is Comrade Brady's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he a boxer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would like to be. Out West, nobody could touch him. He's in the
      championship class. But he has been pottering about New York for a month
      without being able to get a fight. If we had a sporting page on <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> we could do him some good, but I don't see how we can write
      him up," said Smith, picking up a copy of the paper, and regarding it
      gloomily, "in 'Moments in the Nursery' or 'Moments with Budding
      Girlhood.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put up his eyeglass, and stared at the offending journal with the air
      of a vegetarian who has found a caterpillar in his salad. Incredulity,
      dismay, and disgust fought for precedence in his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "B. Henderson Asher," he said severely, "ought to be in some sort of a
      home. Cain killed Abel for telling him that story."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to another page, and scrutinized it with deepening gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Luella Granville Waterman by any chance a friend of yours, Comrade
      Brown? No? I am glad. For it seems to me that for sheer, concentrated
      piffle, she is in a class by herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He read on for a few moments in silence, then looked up and fixed Betty
      with his monocle. There was righteous wrath in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And people," he said, "are paying money for this! <i>Money!</i> Even now
      they are sitting down and writing checks for a year's subscription. It
      isn't right! It's a skin game. I am assisting in a carefully planned skin
      game!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But perhaps they like it," suggested Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is kind of you to try and soothe my conscience, but it is useless. I
      see my position too clearly. Think of it, Comrade Brown! Thousands of
      poor, doddering, half-witted creatures in Brooklyn and Flatbush, who ought
      not really to have control of their own money at all, are getting buncoed
      out of whatever it is per annum in exchange for&mdash;how shall I put it
      in a forcible yet refined and gentlemanly manner?&mdash;for cat's meat of
      this description. Why, selling gold bricks is honest compared with it. And
      I am temporarily responsible for the black business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He extended a lean hand with melodramatic suddenness toward Betty. The
      unexpectedness of the movement caused her to start back in her chair with
      a little exclamation of surprise. Smith nodded with a kind of mournful
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly!" he said. "As I expected! You shrink from me. You avoid my
      polluted hand. How could it be otherwise? A conscientious green-goods man
      would do the same." He rose from his seat. "Your attitude," he said,
      "confirms me in a decision that has been in my mind for some days. I will
      no longer calmly accept this terrible position. I will try to make amends.
      While I am in charge, I will give our public something worth reading. All
      these Watermans and Ashers and Parslows must go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go!" repeated Smith firmly. "I have been thinking it over for days. You
      cannot look me in the face, Comrade Brown, and say that there is a single
      feature which would not be better away. I mean in the paper, not in my
      face. Every one of these punk pages must disappear. Letters must be
      despatched at once, informing Julia Burdett Parslow and the others, and in
      particular B. Henderson Asher, who, on brief acquaintance, strikes me as
      an ideal candidate for a lethal chamber&mdash;that, unless they cease
      their contributions instantly, we shall call up the police reserves. Then
      we can begin to move."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, like most of his acquaintances, seldom knew whether Smith was
      talking seriously or not. She decided to assume, till he should dismiss
      the idea, that he meant what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your kind cooperation, nothing easier. You supply the mechanical
      work. I will compose the letters. First, B. Henderson Asher. 'Dear Sir'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;" she fell back on her original remark&mdash;"but you can't.
      What will Mr. Renshaw say when he comes back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sufficient unto the day. I have a suspicion that he will be the first to
      approve. His vacation will have made him see things differently&mdash;purified
      him, as it were. His conscience will be alive once more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should we worry ourselves because the end of this venture is wrapped
      in obscurity? Why, Columbus didn't know where he was going to when he set
      out. All he knew was some highly interesting fact about an egg. What that
      was, I do not at the moment recall, but I understand it acted on Columbus
      like a tonic. We are the Columbuses of the journalistic world. Full steam
      ahead, and see what happens. If Comrade Renshaw is not pleased, why, I
      shall have been a martyr to a good cause. It is a far, far better thing
      that I do than I have ever done, so to speak. Why should I allow possible
      inconvenience to myself to stand in the way of the happiness which we
      propose to inject into those Brooklyn and Flatbush homes? Are you ready
      then, once more? 'Dear Sir&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the letters were finished, she made one more objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are certain to call here and make a fuss," she said, "Mr. Asher and
      the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think they will not bear the blow with manly fortitude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly do. And I think it's hard on them, too. Suppose they depend
      for a living on what they make from <i>Peaceful Moments?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't," said Smith reassuringly. "I've looked into that. Have no
      pity for them. They are amateurs&mdash;degraded creatures of substance who
      take the cocktails out of the mouths of deserving professionals. B.
      Henderson Asher, for instance, is largely interested in gents'
      haberdashery. And so with the others. We touch their pride, perhaps, but
      not their purses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's soft heart was distinctly relieved by the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," she said. "But suppose they do call, what will you do? It will be
      very unpleasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," he said. "True. I think you are right there. My nervous system is
      so delicately attuned that anything in the shape of a brawl would reduce
      it to a frazzle. I think that, for this occasion only, we will promote
      Comrade Maloney to the post of editor. He is a stern, hard, rugged man who
      does not care how unpopular he is. Yes, I think that would be best."
    </p>
    <p>
      He signed the letters with a firm hand, "per pro P. Maloney, editor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he lit a cigarette, and leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excellent morning's work," he said. "Already I begin to feel the
      dawnings of a new self-respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, thinking the thing over, a little dazed by the rapidity of Smith's
      method of action, had found a fresh flaw in the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you send Mr. Asher and the others away, how are you going to bring the
      paper out at all? You can't write it all yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith looked at her with benevolent admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She thinks of everything," he murmured. "That busy brain is never still.
      No, Comrade Brown, I do not propose to write the whole paper myself. I do
      not shirk work when it gets me in a corner and I can't side-step, but
      there are limits. I propose to apply to a few of my late companions of
      Park Row, bright boys who will be delighted to come across with red-hot
      stuff for a moderate fee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the proprietor of the paper? Won't he make any objection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith shook his head with a touch of reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem determined to try to look on the dark side. Do you insinuate
      that we are not acting in the proprietor's best interests? When he gets
      his check for the receipts, after I have handled the paper awhile, he will
      go singing about the streets. His beaming smile will be a byword. Visitors
      will be shown it as one of the sights. His only doubt will be whether to
      send his money to the bank or keep it in tubs and roll in it. And anyway,"
      he added, "he's in Europe somewhere, and never sees the paper, sensible
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He scratched a speck of dust off his coat-sleeve with his finger nail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a big thing," he resumed. "Wait till you see the first number of
      the new series. My idea is that <i>Peaceful Moments</i> shall become a
      pretty warm proposition. Its tone shall be such that the public will
      wonder why we do not print it on asbestos. We shall comment on all the
      live events of the week&mdash;murders, Wall Street scandals, glove fights,
      and the like, in a manner which will make our readers' spines thrill.
      Above all, we shall be the guardians of the people's rights. We shall be a
      spot light, showing up the dark places and bringing into prominence those
      who would endeavor in any way to put the people in Dutch. We shall detect
      the wrongdoer, and hand him such a series of resentful wallops that he
      will abandon his little games and become a model citizen. In this way we
      shall produce a bright, readable little sheet which will make our city sit
      up and take notice. I think so. I think so. And now I must be hustling
      about and seeing our new contributors. There is no time to waste."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV &mdash; THE HONEYED WORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The offices of Peaceful Moments were in a large building in a street off
      Madison Avenue. They consisted of a sort of outer lair, where Pugsy
      Maloney spent his time reading tales of life on the prairies and heading
      off undesirable visitors; a small room, into which desirable but premature
      visitors were loosed, to wait their turn for admission into the Presence;
      and a larger room beyond, which was the editorial sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith, returning from luncheon on the day following his announcement of
      the great change, found both Betty and Pugsy waiting in the outer lair,
      evidently with news of import.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Smith," began Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey're in dere," said Master Maloney with his customary terseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, exactly?" asked Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De whole bunch of dem."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith inspected Pugsy through his eyeglass. "Can you give me any
      particulars?" he asked patiently. "You are well-meaning, but vague,
      Comrade Maloney. Who are in there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About 'steen of dem!" said Pugsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Asher," said Betty, "and Mr. Philpotts, and all the rest of them."
      She struggled for a moment, but, unable to resist the temptation, added,
      "I told you so."
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile appeared upon Smith's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey just butted in," said Master Maloney, resuming his narrative. "I was
      sittin' here, readin' me book, when de foist of de guys blows in. 'Boy,'
      says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll go in and wait,' says
      he. 'Nuttin' doin',' says I. 'Nix on de goin'-in act.' I might as well
      have saved me breat! In he butts. In about t'ree minutes along comes
      another gazebo. 'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll
      wait,' says he, lightin' out for de door, and in he butts. Wit' dat I sees
      de proposition's too fierce for muh. I can't keep dese big husky guys out
      if dey bucks center like dat. So when de rest of de bunch comes along, I
      don't try to give dem de trun down. I says, 'Well, gent,' I says, 'it's up
      to youse. De editor ain't in, but, if you feels lonesome, push t'roo.
      Dere's plenty dere to keep youse company. I can't be boddered!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what more could you have said?" agreed Smith approvingly. "Tell me,
      did these gentlemen appear to be gay and light-hearted, or did they seem
      to be looking for someone with a hatchet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey was hoppin' mad, de whole bunch of dem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreadfully," attested Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I suspected," said Smith, "but we must not repine. These trifling
      contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high journalistic aims. I
      fancy that with the aid of the diplomatic smile and the honeyed word I may
      manage to win out. Will you come and give me your moral support, Comrade
      Brown?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door of the inner room for Betty, and followed her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Maloney's statement that "about 'steen" visitors had arrived proved
      to be a little exaggerated. There were five men in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Smith entered, every eye was turned upon him. To an outside spectator
      he would have seemed rather like a very well-dressed Daniel introduced
      into a den of singularly irritable lions. Five pairs of eyes were
      smoldering with a long-nursed resentment. Five brows were corrugated with
      wrathful lines. Such, however, was the simple majesty of Smith's demeanor
      that for a moment there was dead silence. Not a word was spoken as he
      paced, wrapped in thought, to the editorial chair. Stillness brooded over
      the room as he carefully dusted that piece of furniture, and, having done
      so to his satisfaction, hitched up the knees of his trousers and sank
      gracefully into a sitting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      This accomplished, he looked up and started. He gazed round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! I am observed!" he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words broke the spell. Instantly the five visitors burst
      simultaneously into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you the acting editor of this paper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to have a word with you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Maloney, I presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like a few moments' conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The start was good and even, but the gentleman who said "Pardon me!"
      necessarily finished first, with the rest nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith turned to him, bowed, and fixed him with a benevolent gaze through
      his eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you Mr. Maloney, may I ask?" enquired the favored one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others paused for the reply. Smith shook his head. "My name is Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Mr. Maloney?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith looked across at Betty, who had seated herself in her place by the
      typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you tell me Mr. Maloney had gone to, Miss Brown? Ah, well,
      never mind. Is there anything <i>I</i> can do for you, gentlemen? I am on
      the editorial staff of this paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, maybe," said a small, round gentleman who, so far, had done only
      chorus work, "you can tell me what all this means? My name is Waterman,
      sir. I am here on behalf of my wife, whose name you doubtless know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Correct me if I am wrong," said Smith, "but I should say it, also, was
      Waterman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Luella Granville Waterman, sir!" said the little man proudly. "My wife,"
      he went on, "has received this extraordinary communication from a man
      signing himself P. Maloney. We are both at a loss to make head or tail of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems reasonably clear to me," said Smith, reading the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an outrage. My wife has been a contributor to this journal since its
      foundation. We are both intimate friends of Mr. Renshaw, to whom my wife's
      work has always given complete satisfaction. And now, without the
      slightest warning, comes this peremptory dismissal from P. Maloney. Who is
      P. Maloney? Where is Mr. Renshaw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus burst forth. It seemed that that was what they all wanted to
      know. Who was P. Maloney? Where was Mr. Renshaw?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the Reverend Edwin T. Philpott, sir," said a cadaverous-looking man
      with light blue eyes and a melancholy face. "I have contributed 'Moments
      of Meditation' to this journal for some considerable time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, yours has always seemed to me work which the world will not
      willingly let die."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Edwin's frosty face thawed into a bleak smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," continued Smith, "I gather that P. Maloney, on the other hand,
      actually wishes to hurry on its decease. Strange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in a serge suit, who had been lurking behind Betty, bobbed into the
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's this fellow Maloney? P. Maloney. That's the man we want to see.
      I've been working for this paper without a break, except when I had the
      grip, for four years, and now up comes this Maloney fellow, if you please,
      and tells me in so many words that the paper's got no use for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are life's tragedies," sighed Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he mean by it? That's what I want to know. And that's what
      these gentlemen want to know. See here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am addressing&mdash;" said Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Asher's my name. B. Henderson Asher. I write 'Moments of Mirth.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      A look almost of excitement came into Smith's face, such a look as a
      visitor to a foreign land might wear when confronted with some great
      national monument. He stood up and shook Mr. Asher reverently by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," he said, reseating himself, "this is a painful case. The
      circumstances, as you will admit when you have heard all, are peculiar.
      You have asked me where Mr. Renshaw is. I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know!" exclaimed Mr. Asher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows. With luck you may find a black cat in a coal cellar on a
      moonless night, but not Mr. Renshaw. Shortly after I joined this journal,
      he started out on a vacation, by his doctor's orders, and left no address.
      No letters were to be forwarded. He was to enjoy complete rest. Who can
      say where he is now? Possibly racing down some rugged slope in the Rockies
      with two grizzlies and a wildcat in earnest pursuit. Possibly in the midst
      of Florida Everglades, making a noise like a piece of meat in order to
      snare alligators. Who can tell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent consternation prevailed among his audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, do you mean to say," demanded Mr. Asher, "that this fellow
      Maloney's the boss here, and that what he says goes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. A man of intensely masterful character, he will brook no
      opposition. I am powerless to sway him. Suggestions from myself as to the
      conduct of the paper would infuriate him. He believes that radical changes
      are necessary in the policy of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, and he will carry
      them through if it snows. Doubtless he would gladly consider your work if
      it fitted in with his ideas. A rapid-fire impression of a glove fight, a
      spine-shaking word picture of a railway smash, or something on those
      lines, would be welcomed. But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never heard of such a thing," said Mr. Waterman indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this life," said Smith, shaking his head, "we must be prepared for
      every emergency. We must distinguish between the unusual and the
      impossible. It is unusual for the acting editor of a weekly paper to
      revolutionize its existing policy, and you have rashly ordered your life
      on the assumption that it is impossible. You are unprepared. The thing
      comes on you as a surprise. The cry goes round New York, 'Comrades Asher,
      Waterman, Philpotts, and others have been taken unawares. They cannot cope
      with the situation.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is to be done?" cried Mr. Asher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, I fear, except to wait. It may be that when Mr. Renshaw, having
      dodged the bears and eluded the wildcat, returns to his post, he will
      decide not to continue the paper on the lines at present mapped out. He
      should be back in about ten weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten weeks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till then, the only thing to do is to wait. You may rely on me to keep a
      watchful eye on your interests. When your thoughts tend to take a gloomy
      turn say to yourselves, 'All is well. Smith is keeping a watchful eye on
      our interests.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the same, I should like to see this P. Maloney," said Mr. Asher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't," said Smith. "I speak in your best interests. P. Maloney is
      a man of the fiercest passions. He cannot brook interference. If you
      should argue with him, there is no knowing what might not happen. He would
      be the first to regret any violent action, when once he had cooled off,
      but&mdash; Of course, if you wish it I could arrange a meeting. No? I
      think you are wise. And now, gentlemen, as I have a good deal of work to
      get through&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "All very disturbing to the man of culture and refinement," said Smith, as
      the door closed behind the last of the malcontents. "But I think that we
      may now consider the line clear. I see no further obstacle in our path. I
      fear I have made Comrade Maloney perhaps a shade unpopular with our late
      contributors, but these things must be. We must clench our teeth and face
      them manfully. He suffers in an excellent cause."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI &mdash; TWO VISITORS TO THE OFFICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once an editor of a paper in the Far West who was sitting at his
      desk, musing pleasantly on life, when a bullet crashed through the window
      and imbedded itself in the wall at the back of his head. A happy smile
      lighted up the editor's face. "Ah!" he said complacently, "I knew that
      personal column of ours would make a hit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      What the bullet was to the Far West editor, the visit of Mr. Martin Parker
      to the offices of <i>Peaceful Moments</i> was to Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred shortly after the publication of the second number of the new
      series, and was directly due to Betty's first and only suggestion for the
      welfare of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the first number of the series had not staggered humanity, it had at
      least caused a certain amount of comment. The warm weather had begun, and
      there was nothing much going on in New York. The papers were consequently
      free to take notice of the change in the policy of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>.
      Through the agency of Smith's newspaper friends, it received some very
      satisfactory free advertisement, and the sudden increase in the sales
      enabled Smith to bear up with fortitude against the numerous letters of
      complaint from old subscribers who did not know what was good for them.
      Visions of a large new public which should replace these Brooklyn and
      Flatbush ingrates filled his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sporting section of the paper pleased him most. The personality of Kid
      Brady bulked large in it. A photograph of the ambitious pugilist, looking
      moody and important in an attitude of self-defense, filled half a page,
      and under the photograph was the legend, "Jimmy Garvin must meet this
      boy." Jimmy was the present holder of the light-weight title. He had won
      it a year before, and since then had confined himself to smoking cigars as
      long as walking sticks and appearing nightly in a vaudeville sketch
      entitled, "A Fight for Honor." His reminiscences were being published in a
      Sunday paper. It was this that gave Smith the idea of publishing Kid
      Brady's autobiography in <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, an idea which won the
      Kid's whole-hearted gratitude. Like most pugilists he had a passion for
      bursting into print. Print is the fighter's accolade. It signifies that he
      has arrived. He was grateful to Smith, too, for not editing his
      contributions. Jimmy Garvin groaned under the supervision of a member of
      the staff of his Sunday paper, who deleted his best passages and altered
      the rest into Addisonian English. The readers of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>
      got their Brady raw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brady," said Smith meditatively to Betty one morning, "has a
      singularly pure and pleasing style. It is bound to appeal powerfully to
      the many-headed. Listen to this. Our hero is fighting one Benson in the
      latter's home town, San Francisco, and the audience is rooting hard for
      the native son. Here is Comrade Brady on the subject: 'I looked around
      that house, and I seen I hadn't a friend in it. And then the gong goes,
      and I says to myself how I has one friend, my old mother down in Illinois,
      and I goes in and mixes it, and then I seen Benson losing his goat, so I
      gives him a half-scissor hook, and in the next round I picks up a
      sleep-producer from the floor and hands it to him, and he takes the
      count.' That is what the public wants. Crisp, lucid, and to the point. If
      that does not get him a fight with some eminent person, nothing will."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What we really need now," he said thoughtfully, "is a good, honest,
      muck-raking series. That's the thing to put a paper on the map. The worst
      of it is that everything seems to have been done. Have you by any chance a
      second 'Frenzied Finance' at the back of your mind? Or proofs that nut
      sundaes are composed principally of ptomaine and outlying portions of the
      American workingman? It would be the making of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that in the course of her rambles through the city Betty
      had lost herself one morning in the slums. The experience had impressed
      itself on her mind with an extraordinary vividness. Her lot had always
      been cast in pleasant places, and she had never before been brought into
      close touch with this side of life. The sight of actual raw misery had
      come home to her with an added force from that circumstance. Wandering on,
      she had reached a street which eclipsed in cheerlessness even its squalid
      neighbors. All the smells and noises of the East Side seemed to be penned
      up here in a sort of canyon. The masses of dirty clothes hanging from the
      fire-escapes increased the atmosphere of depression. Groups of ragged
      children covered the roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was these that had stamped the scene so indelibly on her memory. She
      loved children, and these seemed so draggled and uncared-for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith's words gave her an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know Broster Street, Mr. Smith?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down on the East Side? Yes, I went there once to get a story, one red-hot
      night in August, when I was on the <i>News</i>. The Ice Company had been
      putting up their prices, and trouble was expected down there. I was sent
      to cover it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not add that he had spent a week's salary that night, buying ice
      and distributing it among the denizens of Broster Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an awful place," said Betty, her eyes filling with tears. "Those
      poor children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of those tenement houses are fierce," he said thoughtfully. Like
      Betty, he found himself with a singularly clear recollection of his one
      visit to Broster Street. "But you can't do anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" cried Betty. "Oh, why not? Surely you couldn't have a better
      subject for your series? It's wicked. People only want to be told about
      them to make them better. Why can't we draw attention to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been done already. Not about Broster Street, but about other
      tenements. Tenements as a subject are played out. The public isn't
      interested in them. Besides, it wouldn't be any use. You can't tree the
      man who is really responsible, unless you can spend thousands scaring up
      evidence. The land belongs in the first place to some corporation or
      other. They lease it to a lessee. When there's a fuss, they say they
      aren't responsible, it's up to the lessee. And he, bright boy, lies so low
      you can't find out who it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we could try," urged Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith looked at her curiously. The cause was plainly one that lay near to
      her heart. Her face was flushed and eager. He wavered, and, having
      wavered, he did what no practical man should do. He allowed sentiment to
      interfere with business. He knew that a series of articles on Broster
      Street would probably be so much dead weight on the paper, something to be
      skipped by the average reader, but he put the thought aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he said. "If you care to turn in a few crisp remarks on the
      subject, I'll print them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's first instalment was ready on the following morning. It was a
      curious composition. A critic might have classed it with Kid Brady's
      reminiscences, for there was a complete absence of literary style. It was
      just a wail of pity, and a cry of indignation, straight from the heart and
      split up into paragraphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith read it with interest, and sent it off to the printer unaltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have another ready for next week, Comrade Brown," he said. "It's a long
      shot, but this might turn out to be just what we need."
    </p>
    <p>
      And when, two days after the publication of the number containing the
      article, Mr. Martin Parker called at the office, he felt that the long
      shot had won out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was holding forth on life in general to Betty shortly before the
      luncheon hour when Pugsy Maloney entered bearing a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Martin Parker?" said Smith, taking it. "I don't know him. We make new
      friends daily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a guy wit' a tall-shaped hat," volunteered Master Maloney, "an' he's
      wearing a dude suit an' shiny shoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Parker," said Smith approvingly, "has evidently not been blind to
      the importance of a visit to <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. He has dressed
      himself in his best. He has felt, rightly, that this is no occasion for
      the flannel suit and the old straw hat. I would not have it otherwise. It
      is the right spirit. Show the guy in. We will give him audience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martin Parker proved to be a man who might have been any age between
      thirty-five and forty-five. He had a dark face and a black mustache. As
      Pugsy had stated, in effect, he wore a morning coat, trousers with a
      crease which brought a smile of kindly approval to Smith's face, and
      patent-leather shoes of pronounced shininess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see the editor," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take a seat?" said Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed a chair toward the visitor, who seated himself with the care
      inspired by a perfect trouser crease. There was a momentary silence while
      he selected a spot on the table on which to place his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come about a private matter," he said, looking meaningly at Betty,
      who got up and began to move toward the door. Smith nodded to her, and she
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," said Mr. Parker, "hasn't something happened to this paper these
      last few weeks? It used not to take such an interest in things, used it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very right," responded Smith. "Comrade Renshaw's methods were
      good in their way. I have no quarrel with Comrade Renshaw. But he did not
      lead public thought. He catered exclusively to children with water on the
      brain and men and women with solid ivory skulls. I feel that there are
      other and larger publics. I cannot content myself with ladling out a
      weekly dole of predigested mental breakfast food. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you, I guess," said Mr. Parker, "are responsible for this Broster
      Street thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate, I approve of it and put it in the paper. If any husky guy,
      as Comrade Maloney would put it, is anxious to aim a swift kick at the
      author of that article, he can aim it at me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Mr. Parker. He paused. "It said 'Number one' in the paper.
      Does that mean there are going to be more of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no flaw in your reasoning. There are to be several more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker looked at the door. It was closed. He bent forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here," he said, "I'm going to talk straight, if you'll let me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly, Comrade Parker. There must be no secrets, no restraint between
      us. I would not have you go away and say to yourself, 'Did I make my
      meaning clear? Was I too elusive?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker scratched the floor with the point of a gleaming shoe. He
      seemed to be searching for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say on," urged Smith. "Have you come to point out some flaw in that
      article? Does it fall short in any way of your standard for such work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker came to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were you," he said, "I should quit it. I shouldn't go on with those
      articles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" enquired Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said Mr. Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Smith, and smiled slowly, an ingratiating smile. Smith did
      not respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not completely gather your meaning," he said. "I fear I must ask you
      to hand it to me with still more breezy frankness. Do you speak from
      purely friendly motives? Are you advising me to discontinue the series
      because you fear that it will damage the literary reputation of the paper?
      Do you speak solely as a literary connoisseur? Or are there other
      reasons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentleman whom I represent&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then this is no matter of your own personal taste? There is another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here, I'm representing a gentleman who shall be nameless, and I've
      come on his behalf to tip you off to quit this game. These articles of
      yours are liable to cause him inconvenience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Financial? Do you mean that he may possibly have to spend some of his
      spare doubloons in making Broster Street fit to live in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not so much the money. It's the publicity. There are reasons why he
      would prefer not to have it made too public that he's the owner of the
      tenements down there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he knows what to do. If he makes Broster Street fit for a
      not-too-fastidious pig to live in&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker coughed. A tentative cough, suggesting that the situation was
      now about to enter upon a more delicate phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, see here, sir," he said, "I'm going to be frank. I'm going to put my
      cards on the table, and see if we can't fix something up. Now, see here.
      We don't want any unpleasantness. You aren't in this business for your
      health, eh? You've got your living to make, same as everybody else, I
      guess. Well, this is how it stands. To a certain extent, I don't mind
      owning, since we're being frank with one another, you've got us&mdash;that's
      to say, this gentleman I'm speaking of&mdash;in a cleft stick. Frankly,
      that Broster Street story of yours has attracted attention&mdash;I saw it
      myself in two Sunday papers&mdash;and if there's going to be any more of
      them&mdash;Well, now, here's a square proposition. How much do you want to
      stop those articles? That's straight. I've been frank with you, and I want
      you to be frank with me. What's your figure? Name it, and if you don't
      want the earth I guess we needn't quarrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked expectantly at Smith. Smith, gazing sadly at him through his
      monocle, spoke quietly, with the restrained dignity of some old Roman
      senator dealing with the enemies of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Parker," he said, "I fear that you have allowed your intercourse
      with this worldly city to undermine your moral sense. It is useless to
      dangle rich bribes before the editorial eyes. <i>Peaceful Moments</i>
      cannot be muzzled. You doubtless mean well, according to your somewhat
      murky lights, but we are not for sale, except at fifteen cents weekly.
      From the hills of Maine to the Everglades of Florida, from Portland,
      Oregon, to Melonsquashville, Tennessee, one sentence is in every man's
      mouth. And what is that sentence? I give you three guesses. You give it
      up? It is this: '<i>Peaceful Moments</i> cannot be muzzled!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing doing, then?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker picked up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here," he said, a grating note in his voice, hitherto smooth and
      conciliatory, "I've no time to fool away talking to you. I've given you
      your chance. Those stories are going to be stopped. And if you've any
      sense in you at all, you'll stop them yourself before you get hurt. That's
      all I've got to say, and that goes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, closing the door behind him with a bang that added emphasis
      to his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All very painful and disturbing," murmured Smith. "Comrade Brown!" he
      called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did our late visitor bite a piece out of you on his way out? He was in
      the mood to do something of the sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seemed angry," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He <i>was</i> angry," said Smith. "Do you know what has happened, Comrade
      Brown? With your very first contribution to the paper you have hit the
      bull's-eye. You have done the state some service. Friend Parker came as
      the representative of the owner of those Broster Street houses. He wanted
      to buy us off. We've got them scared, or he wouldn't have shown his hand
      with such refreshing candor. Have you any engagements at present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just going out to lunch, if you could spare me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not alone. This lunch is on the office. As editor of this journal I will
      entertain you, if you will allow me, to a magnificent banquet. <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> is grateful to you. <i>Peaceful Moments,"</i> he added, with
      the contented look the Far West editor must have worn as the bullet came
      through the window, "is, owing to you, going some now."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When they returned from lunch, and reentered the outer office, Pugsy
      Maloney, raising his eyes for a moment from his book, met them with the
      information that another caller had arrived and was waiting in the inner
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dere's a guy in dere waitin' to see youse," he said, jerking his head
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet another guy? This is our busy day. Did he give a name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Says his name's Maude," said Master Maloney, turning a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maude!" cried Betty, falling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith beamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old John Maude!" he said. "Great! I've been wondering what on earth he's
      been doing with himself all this time. Good-old John! You'll like him," he
      said, turning, and stopped abruptly, for he was speaking to the empty air.
      Betty had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Miss Brown, Pugsy?" he said. "Where did she go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy vouchsafed another jerk of the head, in the direction of the outer
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's beaten it," he said. "I seen her make a break for de stairs. Guess
      she's forgotten to remember somet'ing," he added indifferently, turning
      once more to his romance of prairie life. "Goils is bone-heads."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII &mdash; THE MAN AT THE ASTOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Refraining from discussing with Master Maloney the alleged bone-headedness
      of girls, Smith went through into the inner room, and found John sitting
      in the editorial chair, glancing through the latest number of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, John, friend of my youth," he said, "where have you been hiding all
      this time? I called you up at your office weeks ago, and an acid voice
      informed me that you were no longer there. Have you been fired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said John. "Why aren't you on the <i>News</i> any more? Nobody
      seemed to know where you were, till I met Faraday this morning, who told
      me you were here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had
      changed since their last meeting. For a moment he could not have said what
      had given him this impression. Then it flashed upon him. Before, John had
      always been, like Mrs. Fezziwig in "The Christmas Carol," one vast
      substantial smile. He had beamed cheerfully on what to him was evidently
      the best of all possible worlds. Now, however, it would seem that doubts
      had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of things. His face was
      graver. His eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence of disturbing
      happenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of confidences, Smith was not a believer in spade-work. If
      they were offered to him, he was invariably sympathetic, but he never dug
      for them. That John had something on his mind was obvious, but he intended
      to allow him, if he wished to reveal it, to select his own time for the
      revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, for his part, had no intention of sharing this particular trouble
      even with Smith. It was too new and intimate for discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only since his return to New York that the futility of his quest
      had really come home to him. In the belief of having at last escaped from
      Mervo he had been inclined to overlook obstacles. It had seemed to him,
      while he waited for his late subjects to dismiss him, that, once he could
      move, all would be simple. New York had dispelled that idea. Logically, he
      saw with perfect clearness, there was no reason why he and Betty should
      ever meet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To retain a spark of hope beneath this knowledge was not easy and John,
      having been in New York now for nearly three weeks without any
      encouragement from the fates, was near the breaking point. A gray apathy
      had succeeded the frenzied restlessness of the first few days. The
      necessity for some kind of work that would to some extent occupy his mind
      was borne in upon him, and the thought of Smith had followed naturally. If
      anybody could supply distraction, it would be Smith. Faraday, another of
      the temporary exiles from the <i>News</i>, whom he had met by chance in
      Washington Square, had informed him of Smith's new position and of the
      renaissance of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, and he had hurried to the office
      to present himself as an unskilled but willing volunteer to the cause.
      Inspection of the current number of the paper had convinced him that the
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i> atmosphere, if it could not cure, would at least
      relieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faraday told me all about what you had done to this paper," he said. "I
      came to see if you would let me in on it. I want work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent!" said Smith. "Consider yourself one of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never done any newspaper work, of course, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" cried Smith. "Is it so long since the dear old college days that
      you forget the <i>Gridiron?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In their last year at Harvard, Smith and John, assisted by others of a
      congenial spirit, had published a small but lively magazine devoted to
      college topics, with such success&mdash;from one point of view&mdash;that
      on the appearance of the third number it was suppressed by the
      authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were the life and soul of the <i>Gridiron,"</i> went on Smith. "You
      shall be the life and soul of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. You have special
      qualifications for the post. A young man once called at the office of a
      certain newspaper, and asked for a job. 'Have you any specialty?' enquired
      the editor. 'Yes,' replied the bright boy, 'I am rather good at
      invective.' 'Any particular kind of invective?' queried the man up top.
      'No,' replied our hero, 'just general invective.' Such is your case, my
      son. You have a genius for general invective. You are the man <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> has been waiting for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you think so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do think so. Let us consider it settled. And now, tell me, what do you
      think of our little journal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;aren't you asking for trouble? Isn't the proprietor&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith waved his hand airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dismiss him from your mind," he said. "He is a gentleman of the name of
      Benjamin Scobell, who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Benjamin Scobell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who lives in Europe and never sees the paper. I happen to know that he is
      anxious to get rid of it. His solicitors have instructions to accept any
      reasonable offer. If only I could close in on a small roll, I would buy it
      myself, for by the time we have finished our improvements, it will be a
      sound investment for the young speculator. Have you read the Broster
      Street story? It has hit somebody already. Already some unknown individual
      is grasping the lemon in his unwilling fingers. And&mdash;to remove any
      diffidence you may still have about lending your sympathetic aid&mdash;that
      was written by no hardened professional, but by our stenographer. She'll
      be in soon, and I'll introduce you. You'll like her. I do not despair,
      later on, of securing an epoch-making contribution from Comrade Maloney."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, that bulwark of the paper entered in person, bearing an
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Comrade Maloney," said Smith. "Is that your contribution? What is the
      subject? 'Mustangs I have Met?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A kid brought dis," said Pugsy. "Dere ain't no answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith read the letter with raised eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have to get another stenographer," he said. "The gifted author
      of our Broster Street series has quit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said John, not interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quit at a moment's notice and without explanation. I can't understand
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess she had some reason," said John, absently. He was inclined to be
      absent during these days. His mind was always stealing away to occupy
      itself with the problem of the discovery of Betty. The motives that might
      have led a stenographer to resign her position had no interest for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Woman, Woman!" he said resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says she will send in some more Broster Street stuff, though, which
      is a comfort. But I'm sorry she's quit. You would have liked her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there came from the outer office a piercing squeal. It
      penetrated into the editorial sanctum, losing only a small part of its
      strength on the way. Smith looked up with patient sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Comrade Maloney," he said, "is going to take to singing during
      business hours, I fear this journal must put up its shutters. Concentrated
      thought will be out of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the door and flung it open as a second squeal rent the air,
      and found Master Maloney writhing in the grip of a tough-looking person in
      patched trousers and a stained sweater. His left ear was firmly grasped
      between the stranger's finger and thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tough person released Pugsy, and, having eyed Smith keenly for a
      moment, made a dash for the stairs, leaving the guardian of the gate
      rubbing his ear resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He blows in," said Master Maloney, aggrieved, "an' asks is de editor in.
      I tells him no, an' he nips me by the ear when I tries to stop him buttin'
      t'roo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Maloney," said Smith, "you are a martyr. What would Horatius have
      done if somebody had nipped him by the ear when he was holding the bridge?
      It might have made all the difference. Did the gentleman state his
      business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope. Just tried to butt t'roo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of these strong, silent men. The world is full of us. These are the
      perils of the journalistic life. You will be safer and happier when you
      are a cowboy, Comrade Maloney."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith was thoughtful as he returned to the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things are warming up, John," he said. "The sport who has just left
      evidently came just to get a sight of me. Otherwise, why should he tear
      himself away without stopping for a chat. I suppose he was sent to mark me
      down for whichever gang Comrade Parker is employing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" said John. "All this gets past me. Who is Parker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith related the events leading up to Mr. Parker's visit, and described
      what had happened on that occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, before you throw in your lot with this journal," he concluded, "it
      would be well to think the matter over. You must weigh the pros and cons.
      Is your passion for literature such that you do not mind being put out of
      business with a black-jack for the cause? Will the knowledge that a
      low-browed gentleman is waiting round the corner for you stimulate or
      hinder you in your work? There's no doubt now that we are up against a
      tough crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" said John. "I hadn't a notion it was like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You feel, then, that on the whole&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that on the whole this is just the business I've been hunting for.
      You couldn't keep me out of it now with an ax."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith looked at him curiously, but refrained from enquiries. That there
      must be something at the back of this craving for adventure and
      excitement, he knew. The easy-going John he had known of old would
      certainly not have deserted the danger zone, but he would not have
      welcomed entry to it so keenly. It was plain that he was hungry for work
      that would keep him from thought. Smith was eminently a patient young man,
      and though the problem of what upheaval had happened to change John to
      such an extent interested him greatly, he was prepared to wait for
      explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the imminence of the danger he was perfectly aware. He had known from
      the first that Mr. Parker's concluding words were not an empty threat. His
      experience as a reporter had given him the knowledge that is only given in
      its entirety to police and newspaper men: that there are two New Yorks&mdash;one,
      a modern, well-policed city, through which one may walk from end to end
      without encountering adventure; the other, a city as full of sinister
      intrigue, of whisperings and conspiracies, of battle, murder, and sudden
      death in dark byways, as any town of mediaeval Italy. Given certain
      conditions, anything may happen in New York. And Smith realized that these
      conditions now prevailed in his own case. He had come into conflict with
      New York's underworld. Circumstances had placed him below the surface,
      where only his wits could help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have been prepared to see the thing through by himself, but there
      was no doubt that John as an ally would be a distinct comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he felt compelled to give his friend a last chance of
      withdrawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," he said, "there is really no reason why you should&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm going to," interrupted John. "That's all there is to it. What's
      going to happen, anyway? I don't know anything about these gangs. I
      thought they spent all their time shooting each other up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not all, unfortunately, Comrade John. They are always charmed to take on
      a small job like this on the side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what does it come to? Do we have an entire gang camping on our trail
      in a solid mass, or only one or two toughs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely a section, I should imagine. Comrade Parker would go to the main
      boss of the gang&mdash;Bat Jarvis, if it was the Groome Street gang, or
      Spider Reilly and Dude Dawson if he wanted the Three Points or the Table
      Hill lot. The boss would chat over the matter with his own special
      partners, and they would fix it up among themselves. The rest of the gang
      would probably know nothing about it. The fewer in the game, you see, the
      fewer to divide the Parker dollars. So what we have to do is to keep a
      lookout for a dozen or so aristocrats of that dignified deportment which
      comes from constant association with the main boss, and, if we can elude
      these, all will be well."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was by Smith's suggestion that the editorial staff of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> dined that night at the Astor roof-garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tired brain," he said, "needs to recuperate. To feed on such a night
      as this in some low-down hostelry on the level of the street, with German
      waiters breathing heavily down the back of one's neck and two fiddles and
      a piano hitting up ragtime about three feet from one's tympanum, would be
      false economy. Here, fanned by cool breezes and surrounded by passably
      fair women and brave men, one may do a certain amount of tissue-restoring.
      Moreover, there is little danger up here of being slugged by our
      moth-eaten acquaintance of this afternoon. We shall probably find him
      waiting for us at the main entrance with a black-jack, but till then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned with gentle grace to his soup. It was a warm night, and the
      roof-garden was full. From where they sat they could see the million
      twinkling lights of the city. John, watching them, as he smoked a
      cigarette at the conclusion of the meal, had fallen into a dream. He came
      to himself with a start, to find Smith in conversation with a waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my name is Smith," he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter retired to one of the tables and spoke to a young man sitting
      there. John, recollected having seen this solitary diner looking in their
      direction once or twice during dinner, but the fact had not impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man at that table sent over to ask if my name was Smith. It was. He
      is now coming along to chat in person. I wonder why. I don't know him from
      Adam."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was threading his way between the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have a word with you, Mr. Smith?" he said. The waiter brought a
      chair and he seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," said Smith, "my friend, Mr. Maude. Your own name will
      doubtless come up in the course of general chitchat over the coffee-cups."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on your tintype it won't," said the stranger decidedly. "It won't be
      needed. Is Mr. Maude on your paper? That's all right, then. I can go
      ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's about that Broster Street thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More fame!" murmured Smith. "We certainly are making a hit with the great
      public over Broster Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you understand certain parties have got it in against you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A charming conversationalist, one Comrade Parker, hinted at something of
      the sort in a recent conversation. We shall endeavor, however, to look
      after ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll need to. The man behind is a big bug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Search me. You wouldn't expect him to give that away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then on what system have you estimated the size of the gentleman's
      bug-hood? What makes you think that he's a big bug?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the number of dollars he was ready to put up to have you put through."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith's eyes gleamed for an instant, but he spoke as coolly as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" he said. "And which gang has he hired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't say. He&mdash;his agent, that is&mdash;came to Bat Jarvis. Bat
      for some reason turned the job down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did? Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Search me. Nobody knows. But just as soon as he heard who it was he was
      being asked to lay for, he turned it down cold. Said none of his fellows
      was going to put a finger on anyone who had anything to do with your
      paper. I don't know what you've been doing to Bat, but he sure is the
      long-lost brother to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A powerful argument in favor of kindness to animals!" said Smith. "One of
      his celebrated stud of cats came into the possession of our stenographer.
      What did she do? Instead of having the animal made into a nourishing soup,
      she restored it to its bereaved owner. Observe the sequel. We are very
      much obliged to Comrade Jarvis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sent me along," went on the stranger, "to tell you to watch out,
      because one of the other gangs was dead sure to take on the job. And he
      said you were to know that he wasn't mixed up in it. Well, that's all.
      I'll be pushing along. I've a date. Glad to have met you, Mr. Maude.
      Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments after he had gone, Smith and John sat smoking in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the time?" asked Smith suddenly. "If it's not too late&mdash;Hello,
      here comes our friend once more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger came up to the table, a light overcoat over his dress
      clothes. From the pocket of this he produced a watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Force of habit," he said apologetically, handing it to John. "You'll
      pardon me. Good-night again."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII &mdash; THE HIGHFIELD
    </h2>
    <p>
      John looked after him, open-mouthed. The events of the evening had been a
      revelation to him. He had not realized the ramifications of New York's
      underworld. That members of the gangs should appear in gorgeous raiment in
      the Astor roof-garden was a surprise. "And now," said Smith, "that our
      friend has so sportingly returned your watch, take a look at it and see
      the time. Nine? Excellent. We shall do it comfortably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our visit to the Highfield. A young friend of mine who is fighting there
      to-night sent me tickets a few days ago. In your perusal of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> you may have chanced to see mention of one Kid Brady. He is
      the man. I was intending to go in any case, but an idea has just struck me
      that we might combine pleasure with business. Has it occurred to you that
      these black-jack specialists may drop in on us at the office? And, if so,
      that Comrade Maloney's statement that we are not in may be insufficient to
      keep them out? Comrade Brady would be an invaluable assistant. And as we
      are his pugilistic sponsors, without whom he would not have got this fight
      at all, I think we may say that he will do any little thing we may ask of
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly true that, from the moment the paper had taken up his
      cause, Kid Brady's star had been in the ascendant. The sporting pages of
      the big dailies had begun to notice him, until finally the management of
      the Highfield Club had signed him on for a ten-round bout with a certain
      Cyclone Dick Fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should," continued Smith, "if equipped in any degree with the finer
      feelings, be bubbling over with gratitude toward us. At any rate, it is
      worth investigating."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Far away from the comfortable glare of Broadway, in a place of disheveled
      houses and insufficient street-lamps, there stands the old warehouse which
      modern enterprise has converted into the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic
      Club. The imagination, stimulated by the title, conjures up
      picture-covered walls, padded chairs, and seas of white shirt front. The
      Highfield differs in some respects from this fancy picture. Indeed, it
      would be hard to find a respect in which it does not differ. But these
      names are so misleading! The title under which the Highfield used to be
      known till a few years back was "Swifty Bob's." It was a good, honest
      title. You knew what to export, and if you attended seances at Swifty
      Bob's you left your gold watch and your little savings at home. But a wave
      of anti-pugilistic feeling swept over the New York authorities. Promoters
      of boxing contests found themselves, to their acute disgust, raided by the
      police. The industry began to languish. Persons avoided places where at
      any moment the festivities might be marred by an inrush of large men in
      blue uniforms, armed with locust sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then some big-brained person suggested the club idea, which stands
      alone as an example of American dry humor. At once there were no boxing
      contests in New York; Swifty Bob and his fellows would have been shocked
      at the idea of such a thing. All that happened now was exhibition sparring
      bouts between members of the club. It is true that next day the papers
      very tactlessly reported the friendly exhibition spar as if it had been
      quite a serious affair, but that was not the fault of Swifty Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kid Brady, the chosen of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, was billed for a
      "ten-round exhibition contest," to be the main event of the evening's
      entertainment.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A long journey on the subway took them to the neighborhood, and after
      considerable wandering they arrived at their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith's tickets were for a ring-side box, a species of sheep pen of
      unpolished wood, with four hard chairs in it. The interior of the
      Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club was severely free from anything in
      the shape of luxury and ornament. Along the four walls were raised benches
      in tiers. On these were seated as tough-looking a collection of citizens
      as one might wish to see. On chairs at the ringside were the reporters
      with tickers at their sides. In the center of the room, brilliantly
      lighted by half-a-dozen electric chandeliers, was the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were preliminary bouts before the main event. A burly gentleman in
      shirt-sleeves entered the ring, followed by two slim youths in fighting
      costume and a massive person in a red jersey, blue serge trousers, and
      yellow braces, who chewed gum with an abstracted air throughout the
      proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burly gentleman gave tongue in a voice that cleft the air like a
      cannon ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ex-hibit-i-on four-round bout between Patsy Milligan and Tommy Goodley,
      members of this club. Patsy on my right, Tommy on my left. Gentlemen will
      kindly stop smokin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience did nothing of the sort. Possibly they did not apply the
      description to themselves. Possibly they considered the appeal a mere
      formula. Somewhere in the background a gong sounded, and Patsy, from the
      right, stepped briskly forward to meet Tommy, approaching from the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest was short but energetic. At intervals the combatants would
      cling affectionately to one another, and on these occasions the
      red-jerseyed man, still chewing gum and still wearing the same air of
      being lost in abstract thought, would split up the mass by the simple
      method of ploughing his way between the pair. Toward the end of the first
      round Thomas, eluding a left swing, put Patrick neatly to the floor, where
      the latter remained for the necessary ten seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining preliminaries proved disappointing. So much so that in the
      last of the series a soured sportsman on one of the benches near the roof
      began in satirical mood to whistle the "Merry Widow Waltz." It was here
      that the red-jerseyed thinker for the first and last time came out of his
      meditative trance. He leaned over the ropes, and spoke, without heat, but
      firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that guy whistling back up yonder thinks he can do better than these
      boys, he can come right down into the ring."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whistling ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a distinct air of relief when the last preliminary was finished
      and preparations for the main bout began. It did not commence at once.
      There were formalities to be gone through, introductions and the like. The
      burly gentleman reappeared from nowhere, ushering into the ring a
      sheepishly grinning youth in a flannel suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In-ter-<i>doo</i>-cin' Young Leary," he bellowed impressively, "a noo
      member of this club, who will box some good boy here in September."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark. A raucous
      welcome was accorded to the new member.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other notable performers were introduced in a similar manner, and then
      the building became suddenly full of noise, for a tall youth in a bath
      robe, attended by a little army of assistants, had entered the ring. One
      of the army carried a bright green bucket, on which were painted in white
      letters the words "Cyclone Dick Fisher." A moment later there was another,
      though a far less, uproar, as Kid Brady, his pleasant face wearing a
      self-conscious smirk, ducked under the ropes and sat down in the opposite
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ex-hib-it-i-on ten-round bout," thundered the burly gentleman, "between
      Cyclone Dick Fisher&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud applause. Mr. Fisher was one of the famous, a fighter with a
      reputation from New York to San Francisco. He was generally considered the
      most likely man to give the hitherto invincible Jimmy Garvin a hard battle
      for the light-weight championship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you Dick!" roared the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fisher bowed benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;and Kid Brady, member of this&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was noticeably less applause for the Kid. He was an unknown. A few
      of those present had heard of his victories in the West, but these were
      but a small section of the crowd. When the faint applause had ceased,
      Smith rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you Kid!" he observed encouragingly. "I should not like Comrade
      Brady," he said, reseating himself, "to think that he has no friend but
      his poor old mother, as occurred on a previous occasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The burly gentleman, followed by the two armies of assistants, dropped
      down from the ring, and the gong sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fisher sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring. He
      seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone, it is never too
      soon to begin behaving like one. He danced round the Kid with an
      india-rubber agility. The <i>Peaceful Moments</i> representative exhibited
      more stolidity. Except for the fact that he was in fighting attitude, with
      one gloved hand moving slowly in the neighborhood of his stocky chest, and
      the other pawing the air on a line with his square jaw, one would have
      said that he did not realize the position of affairs. He wore the friendly
      smile of the good-natured guest who is led forward by his hostess to join
      in some game to amuse the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his opponent's long left shot out. The Kid, who had been
      strolling forward, received it under the chin, and continued to stroll
      forward as if nothing of note had happened. He gave the impression of
      being aware that Mr. Fisher had committed a breach of good taste and of
      being resolved to pass it off with ready tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cyclone, having executed a backward leap, a forward leap, and a feint,
      landed heavily with both hands. The Kid's genial smile did not even
      quiver, but he continued to move forward. His opponent's left flashed out
      again, but this time, instead of ignoring the matter, the Kid replied with
      a heavy right swing, and Mr. Fisher leaping back, found himself against
      the ropes. By the time he had got out of that uncongenial position, two
      more of the Kid's swings had found their mark. Mr. Fisher, somewhat
      perturbed, scuttled out into the middle of the ring, the Kid following in
      his self-contained, stolid way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cyclone now became still more cyclonic. He had a left arm which seemed
      to open out in joints like a telescope. Several times when the Kid
      appeared well out of distance there was a thud as a brown glove ripped in
      over his guard and jerked his head back. But always he kept boring in,
      delivering an occasional right to the body with the pleased smile of an
      infant destroying a Noah's ark with a tack-hammer. Despite these efforts,
      however, he was plainly getting all the worst of it. Energetic Mr. Fisher,
      relying on his long left, was putting in three blows to his one. When the
      gong sounded, ending the first round, the house was practically solid for
      the Cyclone. Whoops and yells rose from everywhere. The building rang with
      shouts of, "Oh, you Dick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith turned sadly to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," he said, "that this merry meeting looks like doing
      Comrade Brady no good. I should not be surprised at any moment to see his
      head bounce off on to the floor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rounds two and three were a repetition of round one. The Cyclone raged
      almost unchecked about the ring. In one lightning rally in the third he
      brought his right across squarely on to the Kid's jaw. It was a blow which
      should have knocked any boxer out. The Kid merely staggered slightly, and
      returned to business still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the opening of round four there came a subtle change. The Cyclone's
      fury was expending itself. That long left shot out less sharply. Instead
      of being knocked back by it, the <i>Peaceful Moments</i> champion now took
      the hits in his stride, and came shuffling in with his damaging
      body-blows. There were cheers and "Oh, you Dick's!" at the sound of the
      gong, but there was an appealing note in them this time. The gallant
      sportsmen whose connection with boxing was confined to watching other men
      fight and betting on what they considered a certainty, and who would have
      expired promptly if anyone had tapped them sharply on their well-filled
      vests, were beginning to fear that they might lose their money after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifth round the thing became a certainty. Like the month of March,
      the Cyclone, who had come in like a lion, was going out like a lamb. A
      slight decrease in the pleasantness of the Kid's smile was noticeable. His
      expression began to resemble more nearly the gloomy importance of the <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> photographs. Yells of agony from panic-stricken speculators
      around the ring began to smite the rafters. The Cyclone, now but a gentle
      breeze, clutched repeatedly, hanging on like a leech till removed by the
      red-jerseyed referee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a grisly silence fell upon the house. For the Kid, battered, but
      obviously content, was standing in the middle of the ring, while on the
      ropes the Cyclone, drooping like a wet sock, was sliding slowly to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Peaceful Moments</i> wins," said Smith. "An omen, I fancy, Comrade
      John."
    </p>
    <p>
      Penetrating into the Kid's dressing-room some moments later, the editorial
      staff found the winner of the ten-round exhibition bout between members of
      the club seated on a chair having his right leg rubbed by a shock-headed
      man in a sweater, who had been one of his seconds during the conflict. The
      Kid beamed as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gents," he said, "come right in. Mighty glad to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a relief to me, Comrade Brady," said Smith, "to find that you can
      see us. I had expected to find that Comrade Fisher's purposeful wallops
      had completely closed your star-likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, I never felt them. He's a good, quick boy, is Dick, but," continued
      the Kid with powerful imagery "he couldn't hit a hole in a block of
      ice-cream, not if he was to use a coke-hammer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet at one period in the proceedings," said Smith, "I fancied that
      your head would come unglued at the neck. But the fear was merely
      transient. When you began to get going, why, then I felt like some watcher
      of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken, or like stout Cortez
      when with eagle eyes he stared at the Pacific."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?" he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why did I feel like that, Comrade Brady? I will tell you. Because my
      faith in you was justified. Because there before me stood the ideal
      fighting editor of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. It is not a post that any
      weakling can fill. Mere charm of manner cannot qualify a man for the
      position. No one can hold down the job simply by having a kind heart or
      being good at comic songs. No. We want a man of thews and sinews, a man
      who would rather be hit on the head with a half-brick than not. And you,
      Comrade Brady, are such a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock-headed man, who during this conversation had been concentrating
      himself on his subject's left leg now announced that he guessed that would
      about do, and having advised the Kid not to stop and pick daisies, but to
      get into his clothes at once before he caught a chill, bade the company
      goodnight and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brady," he said, "you know those articles about the tenements
      we've been having in the paper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. I read 'em. They're to the good. It was about time some strong
      josher came and put it across 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we thought. Comrade Parker, however, totally disagreed with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I'm coming to," said Smith. "The day before yesterday a man
      named Parker called at the office and tried to buy us off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You gave him the hook, I guess?" queried the interested Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To such an extent, Comrade Brady," said Smith, "that he left breathing
      threatenings and slaughter. And it is for that reason that we have
      ventured to call upon you. We're pretty sure by this time that Comrade
      Parker has put one of the gangs on to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!" exclaimed the Kid. "Gee! They're tough propositions,
      those gangs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we've come along to you. We can look after ourselves out of the
      office, but what we want is someone to help in case they try to rush us
      there. In brief, a fighting editor. At all costs we must have privacy. No
      writer can prune and polish his sentences to his satisfaction if he is
      compelled constantly to break off in order to eject boisterous toughs. We
      therefore offer you the job of sitting in the outer room and intercepting
      these bravoes before they can reach us. The salary we leave to you. There
      are doubloons and to spare in the old oak chest. Take what you need and
      put the rest&mdash;if any&mdash;back. How does the offer strike you,
      Comrade Brady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gents," said the Kid, "it's this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped into his coat, and resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that I've made good by licking Dick, they'll be giving me a chance of
      a big fight. Maybe with Jimmy Garvin. Well, if that happens, see what I
      mean? I'll have to be going away somewhere and getting into training. I
      shouldn't be able to come and sit with you. But, if you gents feel like
      it, I'd be mighty glad to come in till I'm wanted to go into training
      camp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great," said Smith. "And touching salary&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shucks!" said the Kid with emphasis. "Nix on the salary thing. I wouldn't
      take a dime. If it hadn't 'a' been for you, I'd have been waiting still
      for a chance of lining up in the championship class. That's good enough
      for me. Any old thing you want me to do, I'll do it, and glad to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brady," said Smith warmly, "you are, if I may say so, the goods.
      You are, beyond a doubt, supremely the stuff. We three, then,
      hand-in-hand, will face the foe, and if the foe has good, sound sense, he
      will keep right away. You appear to be ready. Shall we meander forth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The building was empty and the lights were out when they emerged from the
      dressing-room. They had to grope their way in darkness. It was raining
      when they reached the street, and the only signs of life were a moist
      policeman and the distant glare of saloon lights down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned off to the left, and, after walking some hundred yards, found
      themselves in a blind alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" said John. "Where have we come to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my trusting way," he said, "I had imagined that either you or Comrade
      Brady was in charge of this expedition and taking me by a known route to
      the nearest subway station. I did not think to ask. I placed myself,
      without hesitation, wholly in your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought the Kid knew the way," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just taggin' along with you gents," protested the light-weight. "I
      thought you was taking me right. This is the first time I been up here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next time we three go on a little jaunt anywhere," said Smith resignedly,
      "it would be as well to take a map and a corps of guides with us.
      Otherwise we shall start for Broadway and finish up at Minneapolis."
    </p>
    <p>
      They emerged from the blind alley and stood in the dark street, looking
      doubtfully up and down it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" said Smith suddenly. "I perceive a native. Several natives, in
      fact. Quite a little covey of them. We will put our case before them,
      concealing nothing, and rely on their advice to take us to our goal."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little knot of men was approaching from the left. In the darkness it was
      impossible to say how many of them were there. Smith stepped forward, the
      Kid at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, sir," he said to the leader, "but if you can spare me a moment
      of your valuable time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden shuffle of feet on the pavement, a quick movement on
      the part of the Kid, a chunky sound as of wood striking wood, and the man
      Smith had been addressing fell to the ground in a heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he fell, something dropped from his hand on to the pavement with a bump
      and a rattle. Stooping swiftly, the Kid picked it up, and handed it to
      Smith. His fingers closed upon it. It was a short, wicked-looking little
      bludgeon, the black-jack of the New York tough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get busy," advised the Kid briefly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX &mdash; THE FIRST BATTLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The promptitude and despatch with which the Kid had attended to the
      gentleman with the black-jack had not been without its effect on the
      followers of the stricken one. Physical courage is not an outstanding
      quality of the New York gangsman. His personal preference is for retreat
      when it is a question of unpleasantness with a stranger. And, in any case,
      even when warring among themselves, the gangs exhibit a lively distaste
      for the hard knocks of hand-to-hand fighting. Their chosen method of
      battling is to lie down on the ground and shoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid's rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of
      confusion. There was no doubt that much had been hoped for from speedy
      attack. Also, the generalship of the expedition had been in the hands of
      the fallen warrior. His removal from the sphere of active influence had
      left the party without a head. And, to add to their discomfiture, they
      could not account for the Kid. Smith they knew, and John was to be
      accounted for, but who was this stranger with the square shoulders and the
      uppercut that landed like a cannon ball? Something approaching a panic
      prevailed among the gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not lessened by the behavior of the intended victims. John was the
      first to join issue. He had been a few paces behind the others during the
      black-jack incident, but, dark as it was, he had seen enough to show him
      that the occasion was, as Smith would have said, one for the shrewd blow
      rather than the prolonged parley. With a shout, he made a football rush
      into the confused mass of the enemy. A moment later Smith and the Kid
      followed, and there raged over the body of the fallen leader a battle of
      Homeric type.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a long affair. The rules and conditions governing the encounter
      offended the delicate sensibilities of the gang. Like artists who feel
      themselves trammeled by distasteful conventions, they were damped and
      could not do themselves justice. Their forte was long-range fighting with
      pistols. With that they felt en rapport. But this vulgar brawling in the
      darkness with muscular opponents who hit hard and often with the clenched
      fist was distasteful to them. They could not develop any enthusiasm for
      it. They carried pistols, but it was too dark and the combatants were too
      entangled to allow them to use these.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one thing to be done. Reluctant as they might be to abandon
      their fallen leader, it must be done. Already they were suffering
      grievously from John, the black-jack, and the lightning blows of the Kid.
      For a moment they hung, wavering, then stampeded in half-a-dozen different
      directions, melting into the night whence they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, full of zeal, pursued one fugitive some fifty yards down the street,
      but his quarry, exhibiting a rare turn of speed, easily outstripped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back, panting, to find Smith and the Kid examining the fallen
      leader of the departed ones with the aid of a match, which went out just
      as John arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid struck another. The head of it fell off and dropped upon the
      up-turned face. The victim stirred, shook himself, sat up, and began to
      mutter something in a foggy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's still woozy," said the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still&mdash;what exactly, Comrade Brady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the air," explained the Kid. "Bats in the belfry. Dizzy. See what I
      mean? It's often like that when a feller puts one in with a bit of weight
      behind it just where that one landed. Gee! I remember when I fought Martin
      Kelly; I was only starting to learn the game then. Martin and me was
      mixing it good and hard all over the ring, when suddenly he puts over a
      stiff one right on the point. What do you think I done? Fall down and take
      the count? Not on your life. I just turns round and walks straight out of
      the ring to my dressing-room. Willie Harvey, who was seconding me, comes
      tearing in after me, and finds me getting into my clothes. 'What's doing,
      Kid?' he asks. 'I'm going fishin', Willie,' I says. 'It's a lovely day.'
      'You've lost the fight,' he says. 'Fight?' says I. 'What fight?' See what
      I mean? I hadn't a notion of what had happened. It was half an hour and
      more before I could remember a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this reminiscence, the man on the ground had contrived to clear his
      mind of the mistiness induced by the Kid's upper cut. The first sign he
      showed of returning intelligence was a sudden dash for safety up the road.
      But he had not gone five yards when he sat down limply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid was inspired to further reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess he's feeling pretty poor," he said. "It's no good him trying to run
      for a while after he's put his chin in the way of a real live one. I
      remember when Joe Peterson put me out, way back when I was new to the game&mdash;it
      was the same year I fought Martin Kelly. He had an awful punch, had old
      Joe, and he put me down and out in the eighth round. After the fight they
      found me on the fire-escape outside my dressing-room. 'Come in, Kid,' says
      they. 'It's all right, chaps,' I says, 'I'm dying.' Like that. 'It's all
      right, chaps, I'm dying.' Same with this guy. See what I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They formed a group about the fallen black-jack expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon us," said Smith courteously, "for breaking in upon your reverie,
      but if you could spare us a moment of your valuable time, there are one or
      two things which we would like to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing," agreed the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place," continued Smith, "would it be betraying professional
      secrets if you told us which particular bevy of energetic cutthroats it is
      to which you are attached?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gent," explained the Kid, "wants to know what's your gang."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man on the ground muttered something that to Smith and John was
      unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be a charity," said the former, "if some philanthropist would
      give this fellow elocution lessons. Can you interpret, Comrade Brady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Says it's the Three Points," said the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Three Points? That's Spider Reilly's lot. Perhaps this <i>is</i>
      Spider Reilly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope," said the Kid. "I know the Spider. This ain't him. This is some
      other mutt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which other mutt in particular?" asked Smith. "Try and find out, Comrade
      Brady. You seem to be able to understand what he says. To me, personally,
      his remarks sound like the output of a gramophone with a hot potato in its
      mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Says he's Jack Repetto," announced the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another interruption at this moment. The bashful Mr. Repetto,
      plainly a man who was not happy in the society of strangers, made another
      attempt to withdraw. Reaching out a pair of lean hands, he pulled the
      Kid's legs from under him with a swift jerk, and, wriggling to his feet,
      started off again down the road. Once more, however, desire outran
      performance. He got as far as the nearest street-lamp, but no further. The
      giddiness seemed to overcome him again, for he grasped the lamp-post, and,
      sliding slowly to the ground, sat there motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid, whose fall had jolted and bruised him, was inclined to be
      wrathful and vindictive. He was the first of the three to reach the
      elusive Mr. Repetto, and if that worthy had happened to be standing
      instead of sitting it might have gone hard with him. But the Kid was not
      the man to attack a fallen foe. He contented himself with brushing the
      dust off his person and addressing a richly abusive flow of remarks to Mr.
      Repetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the rays of the lamp it was possible to discern more closely the
      features of the black-jack exponent. There was a subtle but noticeable
      resemblance to those of Mr. Bat Jarvis. Apparently the latter's oiled
      forelock, worn low over the forehead, was more a concession to the general
      fashion prevailing in gang circles than an expression of personal taste.
      Mr. Repetto had it, too. In his case it was almost white, for the fallen
      warrior was an albino. His eyes, which were closed, had white lashes and
      were set as near together as Nature had been able to manage without
      actually running them into one another. His underlip protruded and
      drooped. Looking at him, one felt instinctively that no judging committee
      of a beauty contest would hesitate a moment before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became apparent that the light of the lamp, though bestowing the
      doubtful privilege of a clearer view of Mr. Repetto's face, held certain
      disadvantages. Scarcely had the staff of <i>Peaceful Moments</i> reached
      the faint yellow pool of light, in the center of which Mr. Repetto
      reclined, than, with a suddenness which caused them to leap into the air,
      there sounded from the darkness down the road the crack-crack-crack of a
      revolver. Instantly from the opposite direction came other shots. Three
      bullets cut grooves in the roadway almost at John's feet. The Kid gave a
      sudden howl. Smith's hat, suddenly imbued with life, sprang into the air
      and vanished, whirling into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought did not come to them consciously at the moment, there being
      little time to think, but it was evident as soon as, diving out of the
      circle of light into the sheltering darkness, they crouched down and
      waited for the next move, that a somewhat skilful ambush had been
      effected. The other members of the gang, who had fled with such remarkable
      speed, had by no means been eliminated altogether from the game. While the
      questioning of Mr. Repetto had been in progress, they had crept back,
      unperceived except by Mr. Repetto himself. It being too dark for
      successful shooting, it had become Mr. Repetto's task to lure his captors
      into the light, which he had accomplished with considerable skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes the battle halted. There was dead silence. The circle of
      light was empty now. Mr. Repetto had vanished. A tentative shot from
      nowhere ripped through the air close to where Smith lay flattened on the
      pavement. And then the pavement began to vibrate and give out a curious
      resonant sound. Somewhere&mdash;it might be near or far&mdash;a policeman
      had heard the shots, and was signaling for help to other policemen along
      the line by beating on the flagstones with his night stick. The noise
      grew, filling the still air. From somewhere down the road sounded the ring
      of running feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De cops!" cried a voice. "Beat it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment the night was full of clatter. The gang was "beating it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith rose to his feet and felt his wet and muddy clothes ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rescue party was coming up at the gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's doing?" asked a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing now," said the disgusted voice of the Kid from the shadows.
      "They've beaten it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle of lamplight became as if by mutual consent a general
      rendezvous. Three gray-clad policemen, tough, clean-shaven men with keen
      eyes and square jaws, stood there, revolvers in one hand, night sticks in
      the other. Smith, hatless and muddy, joined them. John and the Kid, the
      latter bleeding freely from his left ear, the lobe of which had been
      chipped by a bullet, were the last to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's been the rough-house?" inquired one of the policemen, mildly
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know a sport of the name of Repetto?" enquired Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack Repetto? Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He belongs to the Three Points," said another intelligent officer, as one
      naming some fashionable club.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When next you see him," said Smith, "I should be obliged if you would use
      your authority to make him buy me a new hat. I could do with another pair
      of trousers, too, but I will not press the trousers. A new hat is,
      however, essential. Mine has a six-inch hole in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shot at you, did they?" said one of the policemen, as who should say,
      "Tut, tut!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shot at us!" burst out the ruffled Kid. "What do you think's been
      happening? Think an aeroplane ran into my ear and took half of it off?
      Think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop? Think those guys that
      sneaked off down the road was just training for a Marathon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brady," said Smith, "touches the spot. He&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, are you Kid Brady?" enquired one of the officers. For the first time
      the constabulary had begun to display real animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reckoned I'd seen you somewhere!" said another. "You licked Cyclone Dick
      all right, Kid, I hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who but a bone-head thought he wouldn't?" demanded the third warmly.
      "He could whip a dozen Cyclone Dicks in the same evening with his eyes
      shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the next champeen," admitted the first speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he juts it over Jimmy Garvin," argued the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jimmy Garvin!" cried the third. "He can whip twenty Jimmy Garvins with
      his feet tied. I tell you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am loath," observed Smith, "to interrupt this very impressive brain
      barbecue, but, trivial as it may seem to you, to me there is a certain
      interest in this other little matter of my ruined hat. I know that it may
      strike you as hypersensitive of us to protest against being riddled with
      bullets, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's been doin'?" inquired the Force. It was a nuisance, this
      perpetual harping on trifles when the deep question of the light-weight
      championship of the world was under discussion, but the sooner it was
      attended to, the sooner it would be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      John undertook to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Three Points laid for us," he said. "This man, Jack Repetto, was
      bossing the crowd. The Kid put one over on to Jack Repetto's chin, and we
      were asking him a few questions when the rest came back, and started
      shooting. Then we got to cover quick, and you came up and they beat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," said Smith, nodding, "is a very fair <i>precis</i> of the
      evening's events. We should like you, if you will be so good, to corral
      this Comrade Repetto, and see that he buys me a new hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll round Jack up," said one of the policemen indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do it nicely," urged Smith. "Don't go hurting his feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      The second policeman gave it as his opinion that Jack was getting too gay.
      The third policeman conceded this. Jack, he said, had shown signs for some
      time past of asking for it in the neck. It was an error on Jack's part, he
      gave his hearers to understand, to assume that the lid was completely off
      the great city of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too blamed fresh he's gettin'," the trio agreed. They seemed to think it
      was too bad of Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wrath of the Law," said Smith, "is very terrible. We will leave the
      matter, then, in your hands. In the meantime, we should be glad if you
      would direct us to the nearest subway station. Just at the moment, the
      cheerful lights of the Great White Way are what I seem chiefly to need."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      So ended the opening engagement of the campaign, in a satisfactory but far
      from decisive victory for the <i>Peaceful Moments</i>' army.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The victory," said Smith, "was not bloodless. Comrade Brady's ear, my hat&mdash;these
      are not slight casualties. On the other hand, the elimination of Comrade
      Repetto is pleasant. I know few men whom I would not rather meet on a
      lonely road than Comrade Repetto. He is one of nature's black-jackers.
      Probably the thing crept upon him slowly. He started, possibly, in a
      merely tentative way by slugging one of the family circle. His aunt, let
      us say, or his small brother. But, once started, he is unable to resist
      the craving. The thing grips him like dram-drinking. He black-jacks now
      not because he really wants to, but because he cannot help himself.
      There's something singularly consoling in the thought that Comrade Repetto
      will no longer be among those present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are others," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you justly remark," said Smith, "there are others. I am glad we have
      secured Comrade Brady's services. We may need them."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX &mdash; BETTY AT LARGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not till Betty found herself many blocks distant from the office of
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i> that she checked her headlong flight. She had run
      down the stairs and out into the street blindly, filled only with that
      passion for escape which had swept her away from Mervo. Not till she had
      dived into the human river of Broadway and reached Times Square did she
      feel secure. Then, with less haste, she walked on to the park, and sat
      down on a bench, to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitably she had placed her own construction on John's sudden appearance
      in New York and at the spot where only one person in any way connected
      with Mervo knew her to be. She did not know that Smith and he were
      friends, and did not, therefore, suspect that the former and not herself
      might be the object of his visit. Nor had any word reached her of what had
      happened at Mervo after her departure. She had taken it for granted that
      things had continued as she had left them; and the only possible
      explanation to her of John's presence in New York was that, acting under
      orders from Mr. Scobell, he had come to try and bring her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered as she conjured up the scene that must have taken place if
      Pugsy had not mentioned his name and she had gone on into the inner room.
      In itself the thought that, after what she had said that morning on the
      island, after she had forced on him, stripping it of the uttermost rag of
      disguise, the realization of how his position appeared to her, he should
      have come, under orders, to bring her back, was well-nigh unendurable. But
      to have met him, to have seen the man she loved plunging still deeper into
      shame, would have been pain beyond bearing. Better a thousand times than
      that this panic flight into the iron wilderness of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cool and soothing in the park. The roar of the city was hushed. It
      was pleasant to sit there and watch the squirrels playing on the green
      slopes or scampering up into the branches through which one could see the
      gleam of water. Her thoughts became less chaotic. The peace of the summer
      afternoon stole upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take her long to make up her mind that the door of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> was closed to her. John, not finding her, might go away, but
      he would return. Reluctantly, she abandoned the paper. Her heart was heavy
      when she had formed the decision. She had been as happy at <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> as it was possible for her to be now. She would miss Smith and
      the leisurely work and the feeling of being one of a team, working in a
      good cause. And that, brought Broster Street back to her mind, and she
      thought of the children. No, she could not abandon them. She had started
      the tenement articles, and she would go on with them. But she must do it
      without ever venturing into the dangerous neighborhood of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      A squirrel ran up and sat begging for a nut. Betty searched in the grass
      in the hope of finding one, but came upon nothing but shells. The squirrel
      bounded away, with a disdainful flick of the tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think of nothing but food. You ought to be ashamed to be so greedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it came to her suddenly that it was no trifle, this same problem
      of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warm, green park seemed to grow chill and gray. Once again she must
      deal with life's material side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her case was at the same time better and worse than it had been on that
      other occasion when she had faced the future in the French train; better,
      because then New York had been to her something vague and terrifying,
      while now it was her city; worse, because she could no longer seek help
      from Mrs. Oakley.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mrs. Oakley had given John the information which had enabled him to
      discover her hiding-place, Betty felt certain. By what other possible
      means could he have found it? Why Mrs. Oakley, whom she had considered an
      ally, should have done so, she did not know. She attributed it to a change
      of mind, a reconsideration of the case when uninfluenced by sentiment. And
      yet it seemed strange. Perhaps John had gone to her and the sight of him
      had won the old lady over to his side. It might be so. At any rate, it
      meant that the cottage on Staten Island, like the office of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>, was closed to her. She must look elsewhere for help, or trust
      entirely to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on, thinking, with grave, troubled eyes, while the shadows
      lengthened and the birds rustled sleepily in the branches overhead.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Among the good qualities, none too numerous, of Mr. Bat Jarvis, of Groome
      Street in the Bowery, early rising was not included. It was his habit to
      retire to rest at an advanced hour, and to balance accounts by lying abed
      on the following morning. This idiosyncrasy of his was well known in the
      neighborhood and respected, and it was generally held to be both bad taste
      and unsafe to visit Bat's shop until near the fashionable hour for
      luncheon, when the great one, shirt-sleeved and smoking a short pipe,
      would appear in the doorway, looking out upon the world and giving it to
      understand that he was now open to be approached by deserving
      acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, therefore, at ten o'clock in the morning his slumbers were cut short
      by a sharp rapping at the front door, his first impression was that he had
      been dreaming. When, after a brief interval, the noise was resumed, he
      rose in his might and, knuckling the sleep from his eyes, went down,
      tight-lipped, to interview this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got as far as a preliminary "Say!" when speech was wiped from his
      lips as with a sponge, and he stood gaping and ashamed, for the murderer
      of sleep and untimely knocker on front doors was Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis had not forgotten Betty. His meeting with her at the office of
      <i>Peaceful Moments</i> had marked an epoch in his life. Never before had
      anyone quite like her crossed his path, and at that moment romance had
      come to him. His was essentially a respectful admiration. He was content&mdash;indeed,
      he preferred to worship from afar. Of his own initiative he would never
      have met her again. In her presence, with those gray eyes of hers looking
      at him, tremors ran down his spine, and his conscience, usually a battered
      and downtrodden wreck, became fiercely aggressive. She filled him with
      novel emotions, and whether these were pleasant or painful was more than
      he could say. He had not the gift of analysis where his feelings were
      concerned. To himself he put it, broadly, that she made him feel like a
      nickel with a hole in it. But that was not entirely satisfactory. There
      were other and pleasanter emotions mixed in with this humility. The
      thought of her made him feel, for instance, vaguely chivalrous. He wanted
      to do risky and useful things for her. Thus, if any fresh guy should
      endeavor to get gay with her, it would, he felt, be a privilege to fix
      that same guy. If she should be in bad, he would be more than ready to get
      busy on her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had never expected to meet her again, certainly not on his own
      doorstep at ten in the morning. To Bat ten in the morning was included
      with the small hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty smiled at him, a little anxiously. She had no suspicion that she
      played star to Mr. Jarvis' moth in the latter's life, and, as she eyed
      him, standing there on the doorstep, her excuse for coming to him began to
      seem terribly flimsy. Not being aware that he was in reality a tough
      Bayard, keenly desirous of obeying her lightest word, she had staked her
      all on the chance of his remembering the cat episode and being grateful on
      account of it; and in the cold light of the morning this idea, born in the
      watches of the night, when things tend to lose their proportion, struck
      her as less happy than she had fancied. Suppose he had forgotten all about
      it! Suppose he should be violent! For a moment her heart sank. He
      certainly was not a pleasing and encouraging sight, as he stood there
      blinking at her. No man looks his best immediately on rising from bed, and
      Bat, even at his best, was not a hero of romance. His forelock drooped
      dankly over his brow; there was stubble on his chin; his eyes were red,
      like a dog's. He did not look like the Fairy Prince who was to save her in
      her trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I hope you remember me, Mr. Jarvis," she faltered. "Your cat. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded speechlessly. Hideous things happened to his face. He was really
      trying to smile pleasantly, but it seemed a scowl to Betty, and her voice
      died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am&mdash;sure!&mdash;step 'nside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty followed him into the shop. There were birds in cages on the walls,
      and, patroling the floor, a great company of cats, each with its leather
      collar. One rubbed itself against Betty's skirt. She picked it up, and
      began to stroke it. And, looking over its head at Mr. Jarvis, she was
      aware that he was beaming sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes darted away the instant they met hers, but Betty had seen enough
      to show her that she had mistaken nervousness for truculence. Immediately,
      she was at her ease, and womanlike, had begun to control the situation.
      She made conversation pleasantly, praising the cats, admiring the birds,
      touching lightly on the general subject of domestic pets, until her
      woman's sixth sense told her that her host's panic had passed, and that
      she might now proceed to discuss business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you don't mind my coming to you, Mr. Jarvis," she said. "You know
      you told me to if ever I were in trouble, so I've taken you at your word.
      You don't mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis gulped, and searched for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad," he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've left <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. You know I used to be stenographer
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was surprised and gratified to see a look of consternation spread
      itself across Mr. Jarvis' face. It was a hopeful sign that he should take
      her cause to heart to such an extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Jarvis' consternation was not due wholly to solicitude for her.
      His thoughts at that moment, put, after having been expurgated, into
      speech, might have been summed up in the line: "Of all sad words of tongue
      or pen the saddest are these, 'It might have been'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't youse woikin' dere no more? Is dat right?" he gasped. "Gee! I wisht
      I'd 'a' known it sooner. Why, a guy come to me and wants to give me half a
      ton of the long green to go to dat poiper what youse was woikin' on and
      fix de guy what's runnin' it. An' I truns him down 'cos I don't want you
      to be frown out of your job. Say, why youse quit woikin' dere?" His eyes
      narrowed as an idea struck him. "Say," he went on, "you ain't bin fired?
      Has de boss give youse de trun-down? 'Cos if he has, say de woid and I'll
      fix him for youse, loidy. An' it won't set you back a nickel," he
      concluded handsomely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," cried Betty, horrified. "Mr. Smith has been very kind to me. I
      left of my own free will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis looked disappointed. His demeanor was like that of some
      mediaeval knight called back on the eve of starting out to battle with the
      Paynim for the honor of his lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that you said about the man who came to you and offered you
      money?" asked Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind had flashed back to Mr. Parker's visit, and her heart was beating
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! He come to me all right an' wants de guy on de poiper fixed. An' I
      truns him down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! You won't dream of doing anything to hurt Mr. Smith, will you, Mr.
      Jarvis?" said Betty anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if you say so, loidy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your&mdash;friends? You won't let them do anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty breathed freely again. Her knowledge of the East Side was small, and
      that there might be those there who acted independently of Mr. Jarvis,
      disdainful of his influence, did not occur to her. She returned to her own
      affairs, satisfied that danger no longer threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Jarvis, I wonder if you can help me. I want to find some work to do,"
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woik?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to earn my living, you see, and I'm afraid I don't know how to
      begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis pondered. "What sort of woik?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any sort," said Betty valiantly. "I don't care what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis knitted his brows in thought. He was not used to being an
      employment agency. But Betty was Betty, and even at the cost of a headache
      he must think of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of five minutes inspiration came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," he said, "what do youse call de guy dat sits an' takes de money at
      an eatin'-joint? Cashier? Well, say, could youse be dat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be just the thing. Do you know a place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. Just around de corner. I'll take you dere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty waited while he put on his coat, and they started out. Betty chatted
      as they walked, but Mr. Jarvis, who appeared a little self-conscious
      beneath the unconcealed interest of the neighbors, was silent. At
      intervals he would turn and glare ferociously at the heads that popped out
      of windows or protruded from doorways. Fame has its penalties, and most of
      the population of that portion of the Bowery had turned out to see their
      most prominent citizen so romantically employed as a squire of dames.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short walk Bat halted the expedition before a dingy restaurant.
      The glass window bore in battered letters the name, Fontelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dis is de joint," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the restaurant a dreamy-eyed Italian sat gazing at vacancy and
      twirling a pointed mustache. In a far corner a solitary customer was
      finishing a late breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Fontelli, for the sad-eyed exile was he, sprang to his feet at the
      sight of Mr. Jarvis' well-known figure. An ingratiating, but nervous,
      smile came into view behind the pointed mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Tony," said Mr. Jarvis, coming at once to the point, "I want you to
      know dis loidy. She's going to be cashier at dis joint."
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Fontelli looked at Betty and shook his head. He smiled
      deprecatingly. His manner seemed to indicate that, while she met with the
      approval of Fontelli, the slave of her sex, to Fontelli, the employer, she
      appealed in vain. He gave his mustache a sorrowful twirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, no," he sighed. "Not da cashier do I need. I take-a myself da money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis looked at him coldly. He continued to look at him coldly. His
      lower jaw began slowly to protrude, and his forehead retreated further
      behind its zareba of forelock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The signor was plainly embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dis loidy," repeated Mr. Jarvis, "is cashier at dis joint at six per&mdash;"
      He paused. "Does dat go?" he added smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there was magnetism about Mr. Jarvis. With a minimum of words he
      produced remarkable results. Something seemed to happen suddenly to Signor
      Fontelli's spine. He wilted like a tired flower. A gesture, in which were
      blended resignation, humility, and a desire to be at peace with all men,
      particularly Mr. Jarvis, completed his capitulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis waited while Betty was instructed in her simple duties, then
      drew her aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," he remarked confidentially, "youse'll be all right here. Six per
      ain't all de dough dere is in de woild, but, bein' cashier, see, you can
      swipe a whole heap more whenever you feel like it. And if Tony registers a
      kick, I'll come around and talk to him&mdash;see? Dat's right.
      Good-morning, loidy."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, having delivered these admirable hints to young cashiers in a hurry
      to get rich, Mr. Jarvis ducked his head in a species of bow, declined to
      be thanked, and shuffled out into the street, leaving Betty to open her
      new career by taking thirty-seven cents from the late breakfaster.

      CHAPTER XXI &mdash; CHANGES IN THE STAFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days had elapsed since the battle which had opened the campaign, and
      there had been no further movement on the part of the enemy. Smith was
      puzzled. A strange quiet seemed to be brooding over the other camp. He
      could not believe that a single defeat had crushed the foe, but it was
      hard to think of any other explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pugsy Maloney who, on the fourth morning, brought to the office the
      inner history of the truce. His version was brief and unadorned, as was
      the way with his narratives. Such things as first causes and piquant
      details he avoided, as tending to prolong the telling excessively, thus
      keeping him from the perusal of his cowboy stories. He gave the thing out
      merely as an item of general interest, a bubble on the surface of the life
      of a great city. He did not know how nearly interested were his employers
      in any matter touching that gang which is known as the Three Points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy said: "Dere's been fuss'n going on down where I live. Dude Dawson's
      mad at Spider Reilly, and now de Table Hills is layin' for de T'ree
      Points, to soak it to 'em. Dat's right."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then retired to his outer fastness, yielding further details jerkily
      and with the distrait air of one whose mind is elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skilfully extracted and pieced together, these details formed themselves
      into the following typical narrative of East Side life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four really important gangs in New York at this time. There
      were other less important institutions besides, but these were little more
      than mere friendly gatherings of old boyhood chums for purposes of mutual
      companionship. They might grow into formidable organizations in time, but
      for the moment the amount of ice which good judges declared them to cut
      was but small. They would "stick up" an occasional wayfarer for his
      "cush," and they carried "canisters" and sometimes fired them off, but
      these things do not signify the cutting of ice. In matters political there
      were only four gangs which counted, the East Side, the Groome Street, the
      Three Points and the Table Hill. Greatest of these, by virtue of their
      numbers, were the East Side and the Groome Street, the latter presided
      over at the time of this story by Mr. Bat Jarvis. These two were colossal,
      and, though they might fight each other, were immune from attack at the
      hands of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But between the other gangs, and especially between the Table Hill and the
      Three Points, which were much of a size, warfare raged as frequently as
      among the Republics of South America. There had always been bad blood
      between the Table Hill and the Three Points. Little events, trifling in
      themselves, had always occurred to shatter friendly relations just when
      there seemed a chance of their being formed. Thus, just as the Table
      Hillites were beginning to forgive the Three Points for shooting the
      redoubtable Paul Horgan down at Coney Island, a Three Pointer
      injudiciously wiped out a Table Hillite near Canal Street. He pleaded
      self-defense, and in any case it was probably mere thoughtlessness, but
      nevertheless the Table Hillites were ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been a month or so back. During that month things had been
      simmering down, and peace was just preparing to brood when there occurred
      the incident alluded to by Pugsy, the regrettable falling out between Dude
      Dawson and Spider Reilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be as brief as possible, Dude Dawson had gone to spend a happy evening
      at a dancing saloon named Shamrock Hall, near Groome Street. Now, Shamrock
      Hall belonged to a Mr. Maginnis, a friend of Bat Jarvis, and was under the
      direct protection of that celebrity. It was, therefore, sacred ground, and
      Mr. Dawson visited it in a purely private and peaceful capacity. The last
      thing he intended was to spoil the harmony of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the best intentions! Two-stepping clumsily round the room&mdash;for
      he was a poor, though enthusiastic, dancer&mdash;Dude Dawson collided with
      and upset a certain Reddy Davis and his partner. Reddy Davis was a member
      of the Three Points, and his temper was the temper of a red-headed man. He
      "slugged" Mr. Dawson. Mr. Dawson, more skilful at the fray than at the
      dance, joined battle willingly, and they were absorbed in a stirring
      combat, when an interruption occurred. In the far corner of the room,
      surrounded by admiring friends, sat Spider Reilly, monarch of the Three
      Points. He had noticed that there was a slight disturbance at the other
      side of the hall, but had given it little attention till the dancing
      ceasing suddenly and the floor emptying itself of its crowd, he had a
      plain view of Mr. Dawson and Mr. Davis squaring up at each other for the
      second round.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must assume that Mr. Reilly was not thinking of what he did, for his
      action was contrary to all rules of gang etiquette. In the street it would
      have been perfectly legitimate, even praiseworthy, but in a dance-hall
      under the protection of a neutral power it was unpardonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did was to produce his revolver, and shoot the unsuspecting Mr.
      Dawson in the leg. Having done which, he left hurriedly, fearing the wrath
      of Bat Jarvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawson, meanwhile, was attended to and helped home. Willing informants
      gave him the name of his aggressor, and before morning the Table Hill camp
      was in a ferment. Shooting broke out in three places, though there were no
      casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day dawned there existed between the two gangs a state of war
      more bitter than any in their record, for this time it was chieftain who
      had assaulted chieftain, Royal blood had been spilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the explanation of the lull in the campaign against <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>. The new war had taken the mind of Spider Reilly and his
      warriors off the paper and its affairs for the moment, much as the
      unexpected appearance of a mad bull would make a man forget that he had
      come out snipe-shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present there had been no pitched battle. As was usual between the
      gangs, war had broken out in a somewhat tentative fashion at first. There
      had been skirmishes by the wayside, but nothing more. The two armies were
      sparring for an opening.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Smith was distinctly relieved at the respite, for a serious blow had fallen
	  on <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, necessitating careful thought. This was the defection of Kid Brady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid's easy defeat of Cyclone Dick Fisher had naturally created a
      sensation in sporting circles. He had become famous in a night. It was not
      with surprise, therefore, that Smith received from his fighting editor the
      information that he had been matched against one Eddie Wood, whose fame
      outshone even that of the late Cyclone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid, a white man to the core, exhibited quite a feudal loyalty to the
      paper which had raised him from the ruck and placed him on the road to
      eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say the word," he said, "and I'll call it off. If you feel you need me
      around here, Mr. Smith, say so, and I'll side-step Eddie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Brady," said Smith with enthusiasm, "I have had occasion before
      to call you sport. I do so again. But I'm not going to stand in your way.
      If you eliminate this Comrade Wood, they will have to give you a chance
      against Jimmy Garvin, won't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess that's right," said the Kid. "Eddie stayed nineteen rounds
      against Jimmy, and, if I can put him away, it gets me clear into line with
      Jim, and he'll have to meet me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then go in and win, Comrade Brady. We shall miss you. It will be as if a
      ray of sunshine had been removed from the office. But you mustn't throw a
      chance away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll train at White Plains," said the Kid, "so I'll be pretty near in
      case I'm wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we shall be all right," said Smith, "and if you win, we'll bring out
      a special number. Good luck, Comrade Brady, and many thanks for your
      help."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      John, when he arrived at the office and learned the news, was for relying
      on their own unaided efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, anyway," he said, "I don't see who else there is to help us. You
      could tell the police, I suppose," he went on doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The New York policeman, Comrade John, is, like all great men, somewhat
      peculiar. If you go to a New York policeman and exhibit a black eye, he is
      more likely to express admiration for the handiwork of the citizen
      responsible for the same than sympathy. No; since coming to this city I
      have developed a habit of taking care of myself, or employing private
      help. I do not want allies who will merely shake their heads at Comrade
      Reilly and his merry men, however sternly. I want someone who, if
      necessary, will soak it to them good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said John. "But who is there now the Kid's gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who else but Comrade Jarvis?" said Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jarvis? Bat Jarvis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same. I fancy that we shall find, on enquiry, that we are ace high
      with him. At any rate, there is no harm in sounding him. It is true that
      he may have forgotten, or it may be that it is to Comrade Brown alone that
      he is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's Brown?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our late stenographer," explained Smith. "A Miss Brown. She entertained
      Comrade Jarvis' cat, if you remember. I wonder what has become of her. She
      has sent in three more corking efforts on the subject of Broster Street,
      but she gives no address. I wish I knew where she was. I'd have liked for
      you to meet her."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII &mdash; A GATHERING OF CAT SPECIALISTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "It will probably be necessary," said Smith, as they set out for Groome
      Street, "to allude to you, Comrade John, in the course of this interview,
      as one of our most eminent living cat-fanciers. You have never met Comrade
      Jarvis, I believe? Well, he is a gentleman with just about enough forehead
      to prevent his front hair getting inextricably blended with his eyebrows,
      and he owns twenty-three cats, each with a leather collar round its neck.
      It is, I fancy, the cat note which we shall have to strike to-day. If only
      Comrade Brown were with us, we could appeal to his finer feelings. But he
      has seen me only once and you never, and I should not care to bet that he
      will feel the least particle of dismay at the idea of our occiputs getting
      all mussed up with a black-jack. But when I inform him that you are an
      English cat-fancier, and that in your island home you have seventy-four
      fine cats, mostly Angoras, that will be a different matter. I shall be
      surprised if he does not fall on your neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Mr. Jarvis in his fancier's shop, engaged in the intellectual
      occupation of greasing a cat's paws with butter. He looked up as they
      entered, and then resumed his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Jarvis," said Smith, "we meet again. You remember me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope," said Mr. Jarvis promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith was not discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he said tolerantly, "the fierce rush of New York life! How it wipes
      from the retina to-day the image impressed on it but yesterday. Is it not
      so, Comrade Jarvis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat-expert concentrated himself on his patient's paws without
      replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine animal," said Smith, adjusting his monocle. "To what particular
      family of the <i>Felis Domestica</i> does that belong? In color it
      resembles a Neapolitan ice more than anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis' manner became unfriendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, what do youse want? That's straight, ain't it? If youse want to buy
      a boid or a snake, why don't youse say so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stand corrected," said Smith; "I should have remembered that time is
      money. I called in here partly in the hope that, though you only met me
      once&mdash;on the stairs of my office, you might retain pleasant
      recollections of me, but principally in order that I might make two very
      eminent cat-fanciers acquainted. This," he said, with a wave of his hand
      in the direction of John, "is Comrade Maude, possibly the best known of
      English cat-fanciers. Comrade Maude's stud of Angoras is celebrated
      wherever the English language is spoken."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis's expression changed. He rose, and, having inspected John with
      silent admiration for a while, extended a well-buttered hand towards him.
      Smith looked on benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Comrade Maude does not know about cats," he said, "is not knowledge.
      His information on Angoras alone would fill a volume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say"&mdash;Mr. Jarvis was evidently touching on a point which had weighed
      deeply upon him&mdash;"why's catnip called catnip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked at Smith helplessly. It sounded like a riddle, but it was
      obvious that Mr. Jarvis's motive in putting the question was not
      frivolous. He really wished to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The word, as Comrade Maude was just about to observe," said Smith, "is a
      corruption of catmint. Why it should be so corrupted I do not know. But
      what of that? The subject is too deep to be gone fully into at the moment.
      I should recommend you to read Mr. Maude's little brochure on the matter.
      Passing lightly on from that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did youse ever have a cat dat ate bettles?" enquired Mr. Jarvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a time when many of Comrade Maude's <i>Felidae</i> supported
      life almost entirely on beetles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did they git thin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John felt it was time, if he were to preserve his reputation, to assert
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he replied firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis looked astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "English beetles," said Smith, "don't make cats thin. Passing lightly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a cat oncst," said Mr. Jarvis, ignoring the remark and sticking to
      his point, "dat ate beetles and got thin and used to tie itself inter
      knots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A versatile animal," agreed Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," Mr. Jarvis went on, now plainly on a subject near to his heart,
      "dem beetles is fierce. Sure! Can't keep de cats off of eatin' dem, I
      can't. First t'ing you know dey've swallowed dem, and den dey gits thin
      and ties theirselves into knots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should put them into strait-waistcoats," said Smith. "Passing,
      however, lightly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, ever have a cross-eyed cat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade Maude's cats," said Smith, "have happily been almost entirely
      free from strabismus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey's lucky, cross-eyed cats is. You has a cross-eyed cat, and not'in'
      don't never go wrong. But, say, was dere ever a cat wit' one blue and one
      yaller one in your bunch? Gee! it's fierce when it's like dat. It's a
      skidoo, is a cat wit' one blue eye and one yaller one. Puts you in bad,
      surest t'ing you know. Oncst a guy give me a cat like dat, and first t'ing
      you know I'm in bad all round. It wasn't till I give him away to de cop on
      de corner and gets me one dat's cross-eyed dat I lifts de skidoo off of
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what happened to the cop?" enquired Smith, interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he got in bad, sure enough," said Mr. Jarvis without emotion. "One of
      de boys what he'd pinched and had sent up the road once lays for him and
      puts one over on him wit a black-jack. Sure. Dat's what comes of havin' a
      cat wit' one blue and one yaller one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis relapsed into silence. He seemed to be meditating on the
      inscrutable workings of Fate. Smith took advantage of the pause to leave
      the cat topic and touch on matters of more vital import.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tense and exhilarating as is this discussion of the optical peculiarities
      of cats," he said, "there is another matter on which, if you will permit
      me, I should like to touch. I would hesitate to bore you with my own
      private troubles, but this is a matter which concerns Comrade Maude as
      well as myself, and I can see that your regard for Comrade Maude is almost
      an obsession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see," said Smith, "that Comrade Maude is a man to whom you give the
      glad hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis regarded John with respectful affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! He's to the good, Mr. Maude is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly," said Smith. "To resume, then. The fact is, Comrade Jarvis, we
      are much persecuted by scoundrels. How sad it is in this world! We look to
      every side. We look to north, east, south, and west, and what do we see?
      Mainly scoundrels. I fancy you have heard a little about our troubles
      before this. In fact, I gather that the same scoundrels actually
      approached you with a view to engaging your services to do us up, but that
      you very handsomely refused the contract. We are the staff of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Peaceful Moments</i>," said Mr. Jarvis. "Sure, dat's right. A guy
      comes to me and says he wants you put through it, but I gives him de
      trundown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I was informed," said Smith. "Well, failing you, they went to a
      gentleman of the name of Reilly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spider Reilly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. Spider Reilly, the lessee and manager of the Three Points gang."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dose T'ree Points, dey're to de bad. Dey're fresh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too true, Comrade Jarvis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," went on Mr. Jarvis, waxing wrathful at the recollection, "what do
      youse t'ink dem fresh stiffs done de odder night? Started some rough woik
      in me own dance-joint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shamrock Hall?" said Smith. "I heard about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat's right, Shamrock Hall. Got gay, dey did, wit' some of the Table
      Hillers. Say, I got it in for dem gazebos, sure I have. Surest t'ing you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith beamed approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," he said, "is the right spirit. Nothing could be more admirable. We
      are bound together by our common desire to check the ever-growing spirit
      of freshness among the members of the Three Points. Add to that the fact
      that we are united by a sympathetic knowledge of the manners and customs
      of cats, and especially that Comrade Maude, England's greatest fancier, is
      our mutual friend, and what more do we want? Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Maude's to de good," assented Mr. Jarvis, eying John once more in
      friendly fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all to the good," said Smith. "Now, the thing I wished to ask you
      is this. The office of the paper was, until this morning, securely guarded
      by Comrade Brady, whose name will be familiar to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "De Kid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the bull's-eye, as usual. Kid Brady, the coming light-weight champion
      of the world. Well, he has unfortunately been compelled to leave us, and
      the way into the office is consequently clear to any sand-bag specialist
      who cares to wander in. So what I came to ask was, will you take Comrade
      Brady's place for a few days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come in and sit in the office for the next day or so and help
      hold the fort? I may mention that there is money attached to the job. We
      will pay for your services."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis reflected but a brief moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sure," he said. "Me fer dat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent, Comrade Jarvis. Nothing could be better. We will see you
      to-morrow, then. I rather fancy that the gay band of Three Pointers who
      will undoubtedly visit the offices of <i>Peaceful Moments</i> in the next
      few days is scheduled to run up against the surprise of their lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure t'ing. I'll bring me canister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," said Smith. "In certain circumstances one canister is worth a flood
      of rhetoric. Till to-morrow, then, Comrade Jarvis. I am very much obliged
      to you."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Not at all a bad hour's work," he said complacently, as they turned out
      of Groome Street. "A vote of thanks to you, John, for your invaluable
      assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't do much," said John, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently, no. In reality, yes. Your manner was exactly right. Reserved,
      yet not haughty. Just what an eminent cat-fancier's manner should be. I
      could see that you made a pronounced hit with Comrade Jarvis. By the way,
      as he is going to show up at the office to-morrow, perhaps it would be as
      well if you were to look up a few facts bearing on the feline world. There
      is no knowing what thirst for information a night's rest may not give
      Comrade Jarvis. I do not presume to dictate, but if you were to make
      yourself a thorough master of the subject of catnip, for instance, it
      might quite possibly come in useful."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII &mdash; THE RETIREMENT OF SMITH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first member of the staff of <i>Peaceful Moments</i> to arrive at the
      office on the following morning was Master Maloney. This sounds like the
      beginning of a "Plod and Punctuality," or "How Great Fortunes have been
      Made" story, but, as a matter of fact, Master Maloney, like Mr. Bat
      Jarvis, was no early bird. Larks who rose in his neighborhood, rose alone.
      He did not get up with them. He was supposed to be at the office at nine
      o'clock. It was a point of honor with him, a sort of daily declaration of
      independence, never to put in an appearance before nine-thirty. On this
      particular morning he was punctual to the minute, or half an hour late,
      whichever way you choose to look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had only whistled a few bars of "My Little Irish Rose," and had barely
      got into the first page of his story of life on the prairie, when Kid
      Brady appeared. The Kid had come to pay a farewell visit. He had not yet
      begun training, and he was making the best of the short time before such
      comforts should be forbidden by smoking a big black cigar. Master Maloney
      eyed him admiringly. The Kid, unknown to that gentleman himself, was
      Pugsy's ideal. He came from the Plains, and had, indeed, once actually
      been a cowboy; he was a coming champion; and he could smoke big black
      cigars. There was no trace of his official well-what-is-it-now? air about
      Pugsy as he laid down his book and prepared to converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Mr. Smith around anywhere, Pugsy?" asked the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naw, Mr. Brady. He ain't came yet," replied Master Maloney respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Late, ain't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! He generally blows in before I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder what's keepin' him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, John appeared. "Hello, Kid," he said. "Come to say good-by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yep," said the Kid. "Seen Mr. Smith around anywhere, Mr. Maude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hasn't he come yet? I guess he'll be here soon. Hello, who's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A small boy was standing at the door, holding a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Maude?" he said. "Cop at Jefferson Market give me dis fer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" He took the letter, and gave the boy a dime. "Why, it's from
      Smith. Great Scott!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was apparent that the Kid was politely endeavoring to veil his
      curiosity. Master Maloney had no such delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in de letter, boss?" he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letter," said John slowly, "is from Mr. Smith. And it says that he
      was sentenced this morning to thirty days on the Island for resisting the
      police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's de guy!" admitted Master Maloney approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said the Kid. "Mr. Smith been slugging cops! What's he been
      doin' that for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go and find out at once. It beats me."
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take John long to reach Jefferson Market, and by the judicious
      expenditure of a few dollars he was enabled to obtain an interview with
      Smith in a back room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of <i>Peaceful Moments</i> was seated on a bench, looking
      remarkably disheveled. There was a bruise on his forehead, just where the
      hair began. He was, however, cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, John," he said. "You got my note all right, then?" John looked at
      him, concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth does it all mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith heaved a regretful sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear," he said, "I have made precisely the blamed fool of myself that
      Comrade Parker hoped I would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parker!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be misjudging him, but I seem to see the hand of Comrade Parker in
      this. We had a raid at my house last night, John. We were pulled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody&mdash;if it was not Comrade Parker it was some other citizen
      dripping with public spirit&mdash;tipped the police off that certain
      sports were running a pool-room in the house where I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      On his departure from the <i>News</i>, Smith, from motives of economy, had
      moved from his hotel in Washington Square and taken a furnished room on
      Fourteenth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There actually was a pool-room there," he went on, "so possibly I am
      wronging Comrade Parker in thinking that this was a scheme of his for
      getting me out of the way. At any rate, somebody gave the tip, and at
      about three o'clock this morning I was aroused from a dreamless slumber by
      quite a considerable hammering at my door. There, standing on the mat,
      were two policemen. Very cordially the honest fellows invited me to go
      with them. A conveyance, it seemed, waited in the street without. I
      disclaimed all connection with the bad gambling persons below, but they
      replied that they were cleaning up the house, and, if I wished to make any
      remarks, I had better make them to the magistrate. This seemed reasonable.
      I said I would put on some clothes and come along. They demurred. They
      said they couldn't wait about while I put on clothes. I pointed out that
      sky-blue pajamas with old-rose frogs were not the costume in which the
      editor of a great New York weekly paper should be seen abroad in one of
      the world's greatest cities, but they assured me&mdash;more by their
      manner than their words&mdash;that my misgivings were groundless, so I
      yielded. These men, I told myself, have lived longer in New York than I.
      They know what is done, and what is not done. I will bow to their views.
      So I was starting to go with them like a lamb, when one of them gave me a
      shove in the ribs with his night stick. And it was here that I fancy I may
      have committed a slight error of policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled dreamily for a moment, then went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit that the old Berserk blood of the Smiths boiled at that juncture.
      I picked up a sleep-producer from the floor, as Comrade Brady would say,
      and handed it to the big-stick merchant. He went down like a sack of coal
      over the bookcase, and at that moment I rather fancy the other gentleman
      must have got busy with his club. At any rate, somebody suddenly loosed
      off some fifty thousand dollars' worth of fireworks, and the next thing I
      knew was that the curtain had risen for the next act on me, discovered
      sitting in a prison cell, with an out-size in lumps on my forehead."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What <i>Peaceful Moments</i> really needs," he said, "is a <i>sitz-redacteur</i>.
      A <i>sitz-redacteur</i>, John, is a gentleman employed by German
      newspapers with a taste for <i>lese-majeste</i> to go to prison whenever
      required in place of the real editor. The real editor hints in his bright
      and snappy editorial, for instance, that the Kaiser's mustache gives him
      bad dreams. The police force swoops down in a body on the office of the
      journal, and are met by the <i>sitz-redacteur</i>, who goes with them
      cheerfully, allowing the editor to remain and sketch out plans for his
      next week's article on the Crown Prince. We need a <i>sitz-redacteur</i>
      on <i>Peaceful Moments</i> almost as much as a fighting editor. Not now,
      of course. This has finished the thing. You'll have to close down the
      paper now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close it down!" cried John. "You bet I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear old son," said Smith seriously, "what earthly reason have you for
      going on with it? You only came in to help me, and I am no more. I am gone
      like some beautiful flower that withers in the night. Where's the sense of
      getting yourself beaten up then? Quit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't quit now if you paid me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A policeman appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, pal," he remarked to John, "you'll have to be fading away soon, I
      guess. Give you three minutes more. Say it quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      He retired. Smith looked at John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't quit?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're an all-wool sport, John," he said. "I don't suppose you know how
      to spell quit. Well, then, if you are determined to stand by the ship like
      Comrade Casabianca, I'll tell you an idea that came to me in the watches
      of the night. If ever you want to get ideas, John, you spend a night in
      one of these cells. They flock to you. I suppose I did more profound
      thinking last night than I've ever done in my life. Well, here's the idea.
      Act on it or not, as you please. I was thinking over the whole business
      from soup to nuts, and it struck me that the queerest part of it all is
      that whoever owns these Broster Street tenements should care a Canadian
      dime whether we find out who he is or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's the publicity," began John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush!" said Smith. "And possibly bah! Do you suppose that the sort of man
      who runs Broster Street is likely to care a darn about publicity? What
      does it matter to him if the papers soak it to him for about two days? He
      knows they'll drop him and go on to something else on the third, and he
      knows he's broken no law. No, there's something more in this business than
      that. Don't think that this bright boy wants to hush us up simply because
      he is a sensitive plant who can't bear to think that people should be
      cross with him. He has got some private reason for wanting to lie low."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but what difference&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade, I'll tell you. It makes this difference: that the rents are
      almost certainly collected by some confidential person belonging to his
      own crowd, not by an ordinary collector. In other words, the collector
      knows the name of the man he's collecting for. But for this little
      misfortune of mine, I was going to suggest that we waylay that collector,
      administer the Third Degree, and ask him who his boss is."
    </p>
    <p>
      John uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right! I'll do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think you can? Alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! Don't you worry. I'll&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and the policeman reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time's up. Slide, sonny."
    </p>
    <p>
      John said good-by to Smith, and went out. He had a last glimpse of his
      late editor, a sad smile on his face, telling the policeman what was
      apparently a humorous story. Complete good will seemed to exist between
      them. John consoled himself as he went away with the reflection that
      Smith's was a temperament that would probably find a bright side even to a
      thirty-days' visit to Blackwell's Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked thoughtfully back to the office. There was something lonely, and
      yet wonderfully exhilarating, in the realization that he was now alone and
      in sole charge of the campaign. It braced him. For the first time in
      several weeks he felt positively light-hearted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV &mdash; THE CAMPAIGN QUICKENS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis was as good as his word. Early in the afternoon he made his
      appearance at the office of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, his forelock more
      than usually well oiled in honor of the occasion, and his right
      coat-pocket bulging in a manner that betrayed to the initiated eye the
      presence of his trusty "canister." With him, in addition, he brought a
      long, thin young man who wore under his brown tweed coat a blue-and-red
      striped sweater. Whether he brought him as an ally in case of need or
      merely as a kindred soul with whom he might commune during his vigil, did
      not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy, startled out of his wonted calm by the arrival of this
      distinguished company, gazed after the pair, as they passed into the inner
      office, with protruding eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John greeted the allies warmly, and explained Smith's absence. Mr. Jarvis
      listened to the story with interest, and introduced his colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      "T'ought I'd let him chase along. Long Otto's his monaker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure!" said John. "The more the merrier. Take a seat. You'll find cigars
      over there. You won't mind my not talking for the moment? There's a wad of
      work to clear up."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an overstatement. He was comparatively free of work, press day
      having only just gone by; but he was keenly anxious to avoid conversation
      on the subject of cats, of his ignorance of which Mr. Jarvis's appearance
      had suddenly reminded him. He took up an old proof sheet and began to
      glance through it, frowning thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis regarded the paraphernalia of literature on the table with
      interest. So did Long Otto, who, however, being a man of silent habit,
      made no comment. Throughout the seance and the events which followed it he
      confined himself to an occasional grunt. He seemed to lack other modes of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is dis where youse writes up pieces fer de poiper?" enquired Mr. Jarvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the spot," said John. "On busy mornings you could hear our brains
      buzzing in Madison Square Garden. Oh, one moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and went into the outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pugsy," he said, "do you know Broster Street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you find out for me exactly when the man comes round collecting the
      rents?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surest t'ing you know. I knows a kid what knows anodder kid what lives
      dere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then go and do it now. And, after you've found out, you can take the rest
      of the day off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me fer dat," said Master Maloney with enthusiasm. "I'll take me goil to
      de Bronx Zoo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your girl? I didn't know you'd got a girl, Pugsy. I always imagined you
      as one of those strong, stern, blood-and-iron men who despised girls. Who
      is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, she's a kid," said Pugsy. "Her pa runs a delicatessen shop down our
      street. She ain't a bad mutt," added the ardent swain. "I'm her steady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, mind you send me a card for the wedding. And if two dollars would
      be a help&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure t'ing. T'anks, boss. You're all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      It had occurred to John that the less time Pugsy spent in the outer office
      during the next few days, the better. The lull in the warfare could not
      last much longer, and at any moment a visit from Spider Reilly and his
      adherents might be expected. Their probable first move in such an event
      would be to knock Master Maloney on the head to prevent his giving warning
      of their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events proved that he had not been mistaken. He had not been back in the
      inner office for more than a quarter of an hour when there came from
      without the sound of stealthy movements. The handle of the door began&mdash;to
      revolve slowly and quietly. The next moment three figures tumbled into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that they had not expected to find the door unlocked, and
      the absence of resistance when they applied their weight had surprising
      effects. Two of the three did not pause in their career till they cannoned
      against the table. The third checked himself by holding the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      John got up coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come right in," he said. "What can we do for you?" It had been too dark
      on the other occasion of his meeting with the Three Pointers to take note
      of their faces, though he fancied that he had seen the man holding the
      door-handle before. The others were strangers. They were all exceedingly
      unprepossessing in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The three marauders had become aware of the presence of
      Mr. Jarvis and his colleague, and the meeting was causing them
      embarrassment, which may have been due in part to the fact that both had
      produced and were toying meditatively with ugly-looking pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "what's doin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom the question was directly addressed appeared to have some
      difficulty in finding a reply. He shuffled his feet, and looked at the
      floor. His two companions seemed equally at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goin' to start anything?" enquired Mr. Jarvis, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The humor of the situation suddenly tickled John. The embarrassment of the
      uninvited guests was ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've just dropped in for a quiet chat, is that it?" he said. "Well,
      we're all delighted to see you. The cigars are on the table. Draw up your
      chairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis opposed the motion. He drew slow circles in the air with his
      revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say! Youse had best beat it. See?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Long Otto grunted sympathy with the advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And youse had best go back to Spider Reilly," continued Mr. Jarvis, "and
      tell him there ain't nothin' doing in the way of rough-house wit' dis gent
      here. And you can tell de Spider," went on Bat with growing ferocity, "dat
      next time he gits fresh and starts in to shootin' up my dance-joint, I'll
      bite de head off'n him. See? Dat goes. If he t'inks his little two-by-four
      crowd can git way wit' de Groome Street, he's got anodder guess comin'.
      An' don't fergit dis gent here and me is friends, and anyone dat starts
      anyt'ing wit' dis gent is going to find trouble. Does dat go? Beat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He jerked his shoulder in the direction of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delegation then withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," said John. "I'm much obliged to you both. You're certainly there
      with the goods as fighting editors. I don't know what I should have done
      without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, Chee!" said Mr. Jarvis, handsomely dismissing the matter. Long Otto
      kicked the leg of a table, and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy Maloney's report on the following morning was entirely satisfactory.
      Rents were collected in Broster Street on Thursdays. Nothing could have
      been more convenient, for that very day happened to be Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rubbered around," said Pugsy, "an' done de sleut' act, an' it's this
      way. Dere's a feller blows in every T'ursday 'bout six o'clock, an' den
      it's up to de folks to dig down inter deir jeans for de stuff, or out dey
      goes before supper. I got dat from my kid frien' what knows a kid what
      lives dere. An' say, he has it pretty fierce, dat kid. De kid what lives
      dere. He's a wop kid, an Italian, an' he's in bad 'cos his pa comes over
      from Italy to woik on de subway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why that puts him in bad," said John wonderingly. "You don't
      construct your stories well, Pugsy. You start at the end, then go back to
      any part which happens to appeal to you at the moment, and eventually wind
      up at the beginning. Why is this kid in bad because his father has come to
      work on the subway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sure, because his pa got fired an' swatted de foreman one on de
      coco, an' dey gives him t'oity days. So de kid's all alone, an' no one to
      pay de rent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said John. "Well, come along with me and introduce me, and I'll
      look after that."
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five John closed the office for the day, and, armed with a
      big stick and conducted by Master Maloney, made his way to Broster Street.
      To reach it, it was necessary to pass through a section of the enemy's
      country, but the perilous passage was safely negotiated. The expedition
      reached its unsavory goal intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wop kid inhabited a small room at the very top of a building half-way
      down the street. He was out when John and Pugsy arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an abode of luxury, the tenement; they had to feel their way up
      the stairs in almost pitch darkness. Most of the doors were shut, but one
      on the second floor was ajar. Through the opening John had a glimpse of a
      number of women sitting on up-turned boxes. The floor was covered with
      little heaps of linen. All the women were sewing. Stumbling in the
      darkness, John almost fell against the door. None of the women looked up
      at the noise. In Broster Street time was evidently money.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the top floor Pugsy halted before the open door of an empty room. The
      architect in this case had apparently given rein to a passion for
      originality, for he had constructed the apartment without a window of any
      sort whatsoever. The entire stock of air used by the occupants came
      through a small opening over the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm day, and John recoiled hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this the kid's room?" he said. "I guess the corridor's good enough for
      me to wait in. What the owner of this place wants," he went on
      reflectively, "is scalping. Well, we'll do it in the paper if we can't in
      any other way. Is this your kid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A small boy had appeared. He seemed surprised to see visitors. Pugsy
      undertook to do the honors. Pugsy, as interpreter, was energetic, but not
      wholly successful. He appeared to have a fixed idea that the Italian
      language was one easily mastered by the simple method of saying "da"
      instead of "the," and adding a final "a" to any word that seemed to him to
      need one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, kid," he began, "has da rent-a-man come yet-a?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The black eyes of the wop kid clouded. He gesticulated, and said something
      in his native language.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hasn't got next," reported Master Maloney. "He can't git on to me
      curves. Dese wop kids is all bone-heads. Say, kid, look-a here." He walked
      to the door, rapped on it smartly, and, assuming a look of extreme
      ferocity, stretched out his hand and thundered: "Unbelt-a! Slip-a me da
      stuff!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The wop kid's puzzlement in the face of this address became pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," said John, deeply interested, "is getting exciting. Don't give in,
      Pugsy. I guess the trouble is that your too perfect Italian accent is
      making the kid homesick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Maloney made a gesture of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm t'roo. Dese Dagoes makes me tired. Dey don't know enough to go
      upstairs to take de elevated. Beat it, you mutt," he observed with moody
      displeasure, accompanying the words with a gesture which conveyed its own
      meaning. The wop kid, plainly glad to get away, slipped down the stairs
      like a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boss," he said resignedly, "it's up to youse."
    </p>
    <p>
      John reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right," he said. "Of course, if the collector had been here, the
      kid wouldn't be. All I've got to do is to wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      He peered over the banisters into the darkness below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that it's not enough," he said; "for of all the poisonous places I
      ever met this is the worst. I wish whoever built it had thought to put in
      a few windows. His idea of ventilation was apparently to leave a hole
      about the size of a lima bean and let the thing go at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess there's a door on to de roof somewhere," suggested Pugsy. "At de
      joint where I lives dere is."
    </p>
    <p>
      His surmise proved correct. At the end of the passage a ladder, nailed
      against the wall, ended in a large square opening, through which was
      visible, if not "that narrow strip of blue which prisoners call the sky,"
      at any rate a tall brick chimney and a clothesline covered with garments
      that waved lazily in the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stood beneath it, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "this isn't much, but it's better than nothing. I suppose
      the architect of this place was one of those fellows who don't begin to
      appreciate air till it's thick enough to scoop chunks out with a spoon.
      It's an acquired taste, I guess, like Limburger cheese. And now, Pugsy,
      old scout, you had better beat it. There may be a rough-house here any
      minute now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy looked up, indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beat it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "While your shoe-leather's good," said John firmly. "This is no place for
      a minister's son. Take it from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to stop and pipe de fun," objected Master Maloney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What fun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you ain't here to play ball," surmised Pugsy shrewdly, eying the
      big stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind why I'm here," said John. "Beat it. I'll tell you all about it
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Maloney prepared reluctantly to depart. As he did so there was a
      sound of well-shod feet on the stairs, and a man in a snuff-colored suit,
      wearing a brown Homburg hat and carrying a small notebook in one hand,
      walked briskly up the stairs. His whole appearance proclaimed him to be
      the long-expected collector of rents.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV &mdash; CORNERED
    </h2>
    <p>
      He did not see John for a moment, and had reached the door of the room
      when he became aware of a presence. He turned in surprise. He was a
      smallish, pale-faced man with protruding eyes and teeth which gave him a
      certain resemblance to a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Welcome to our city," said John, stepping unostentatiously between him
      and the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Maloney, who had taken advantage of the interruption to edge back
      into the center of things, now appeared to consider the question of his
      departure permanently shelved. He sidled to a corner of the landing, and
      sat down on an empty soap box with the air of a dramatic critic at the
      opening night of a new play. The scene looked good to him. It promised
      interesting developments. He was an earnest student of the drama, as
      exhibited in the theaters of the East Side, and few had ever applauded the
      hero of "Escaped from Sing Sing," or hissed the villain of "Nellie, the
      Beautiful Cloak-model" with more fervor. He liked his drama to have plenty
      of action, and to his practised eye this one promised well. There was a
      set expression on John's face which suggested great things.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pleasure was abruptly quenched. John, placing a firm hand on his
      collar, led him to the top of the stairs and pushed him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beat it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rent-collector watched these things with a puzzled eye. He now turned
      to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, seen anything of the wops that live here?" he enquired. "My name's
      Gooch. I've come to take the rent."
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think there's much chance of your seeing them to-night," he said.
      "The father, I hear, is in prison. You won't get any rent out of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's outside for theirs," said Mr. Gooch definitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the kid?" said John. "Where's he to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's up to him. Nothing to do with me. I'm only acting under orders
      from up top."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose orders?" enquired John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gent who owns this joint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspicion crept into the protruding eyes of the rent-collector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!" he demanded. "Who are you anyway, and what do you think you're
      doing here? That's what I'd like to know. What do you want with the name
      of the owner of this place? What business is it of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a newspaper man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guessed you were," said Mr. Gooch with triumph. "You can't bluff me.
      Well, it's no good, sonny. I've nothing for you. You'd better chase off
      and try something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      He became more friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, though," he said, "I just guessed you were from some paper. I wish I
      could give you a story, but I can't. I guess it's this <i>Peaceful Moments</i>
      business that's been and put your editor on to this joint, ain't it? Say,
      though, that's a queer thing, that paper. Why, only a few weeks ago it
      used to be a sort of take-home-and-read-to-the-kids affair. A friend of
      mine used to buy it regular. And then suddenly it comes out with a regular
      whoop, and starts knocking these tenements and boosting Kid Brady, and all
      that. It gets past me. All I know is that it's begun to get this place
      talked about. Why, you see for yourself how it is. Here is your editor
      sending you down to get a story about it. But, say, those <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> guys are taking big risks. I tell you straight they are, and I
      know. I happen to be wise to a thing or two about what's going on on the
      other side, and I tell you there's going to be something doing if they
      don't cut it out quick. Mr. Qem, the fellow who owns this place isn't the
      man to sit still and smile. He's going to get busy. Say, what paper do you
      come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Peaceful Moments</i>," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the inwardness of the information did not seem to come home
      to Mr. Gooch. Then it hit him. He spun round. John was standing squarely
      between him and the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, what's all this?" demanded Mr. Gooch nervously. The light was dim in
      the passage, but it was sufficiently light to enable him to see John's
      face, and it did not reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll soon tell you," said John. "First, however, let's get this business
      of the kid's rent settled. Take it out of this and give me the receipt."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out a bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse his rent," said Mr. Gooch. "Let me pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon," said John. "Business before pleasure. How much does the kid have
      to pay for the privilege of suffocating in this infernal place? As much as
      that? Well, give me a receipt, and then we can get on to more important
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Receipt," said John laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gooch looked at the big stick, then scribbled a few words in his
      notebook and tore out the page. John thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see that it reaches him," he said. "And now will you kindly tell
      me the name of the man for whom you collected that money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me pass," bellowed Mr. Gooch. "I'll bring an action against you for
      assault and battery. Playing a fool game like this! Get away from those
      stairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There has been no assault and battery&mdash;yet," said John. "Well, are
      you going to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gooch shuffled restlessly. John leaned against the banisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you said a moment ago," he observed, "the staff of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>
      is taking big risks. I knew it before you told me. I have had practical
      demonstration of the fact. And that is why this Broster Street thing has
      got to be finished quick. We can't afford to wait. So I am going to have
      you tell me this man's name right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help!" yelled Mr. Gooch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise died away, echoing against the walls. No answering cry came from
      below. Custom had staled the piquancy of such cries in Broster Street. If
      anybody heard it, nobody thought the matter worth investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do that again," said John, "I'll break you in half. Now then! I
      can't wait much longer. Get busy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked huge and sinister to Mr. Gooch, standing there in the uncertain
      light; it was very lonely on that top floor and the rest of the world
      seemed infinitely far away. Mr. Gooch wavered. He was loyal to his
      employer, but he was still more loyal to Mr. Gooch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clatter on the stairs of one running swiftly, and Pugsy
      Maloney burst into view. For the first time since John had known him,
      Pugsy was openly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, boss," he cried, "dey's coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, dem. I seen dem T'ree Pointers&mdash;Spider Reilly an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off with a yelp of surprise. Mr. Gooch had seized his
      opportunity, and had made his dash for safety. With a rush he dived past
      John, nearly upsetting Pugsy, who stood in his path, and sprang down the
      stairs. Once he tripped, but recovered himself, and in another instant
      only the faint sound of his hurrying footsteps reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      John had made a movement as if to follow, but the full meaning of Pugsy's
      words came upon him and he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spider Reilly?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess it was Spider Reilly," said Pugsy, excitedly. "Dey called him
      Spider. I guess dey piped youse comin' in here. Gee! it's pretty fierce,
      boss, dis! What youse goin' to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you see them, Pugsy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the street just outside. Dere was a bunch of dem spielin' togedder,
      and I hears dem say you was in here. Dere ain't no ways out but de front,
      so dey ain't hurryin'. Dey just reckon to pike along upstairs, peekin'
      inter each room till dey find you. An' dere's a bunch of dem goin' to wait
      on de street in case youse beat it past down de stairs while de odder guys
      is rubberin' for youse. Gee, ain't dis de limit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John stood thinking. His mind was working rapidly. Suddenly he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, Pugsy," he said. "It looks bad, but I see a way out. I'm
      going up that ladder there and through the trapdoor on to the roof. I
      shall be all right there. If they find me, they can only get at me one at
      a time. And, while I'm there, here's what I want you to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I go for de cops, boss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the cops. Do you know where Dude Dawson lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of intelligence began to shine in Master Maloney's face. His eye
      glistened with approval. This was strategy of the right sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can ask around," he said. "I'll soon find him all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, and as quick as you can. And when you've found him tell him that his
      old chum, Spider Reilly, is here, with the rest of his crowd. And now I'd
      better be getting up on to my perch. Off you go, Pugsy, my son, and don't
      take a week about it. Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy vanished, and John, going to the ladder, climbed out on to the roof
      with his big stick. He looked about him. The examination was satisfactory.
      The trapdoor appeared to be the only means of access to the roof, and
      between this roof and that of the next building there was a broad gulf.
      The position was practically impregnable. Only one thing could undo him,
      and that was, if the enemy should mount to the next roof and shoot from
      there. And even then he would have cover in the shape of the chimney. It
      was a pity that the trap opened downward, for he had no means of securing
      it and was obliged to allow it to hang open. But, except for that, his
      position could hardly have been stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet there was no sound of the enemy's approach. Evidently, as Pugsy had
      said, they were conducting the search, room by room, in a thorough and
      leisurely way. He listened with his ear close to the open trapdoor, but
      could hear nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A startled exclamation directly behind him brought him to his feet in a
      flash, every muscle tense. He whirled his stick above his head as he
      turned, ready to strike, then let it fall with a clatter. For there, a
      bare yard away, stood Betty.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI &mdash; JOURNEY'S END
    </h2>
    <p>
      The capacity of the human brain for surprise, like that of the human body
      for pain, is limited. For a single instant a sense of utter unreality
      struck John like a physical blow. The world flickered before his eyes and
      the air seemed full of strange noises. Then, quite suddenly, these things
      passed, and he found himself looking at her with a total absence of
      astonishment, mildly amused in some remote corner of his brain at his own
      calm. It was absurd, he told himself, that he should be feeling as if he
      had known of her presence there all the time. Yet it was so. If this were
      a dream, he could not be taking the miracle more as a matter of course.
      Joy at the sight of her he felt, keen and almost painful, but no surprise.
      The shock had stunned his sense of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing a calico apron over her dress, an apron that had evidently
      been designed for a large woman. Swathed in its folds, she suggested a
      child playing at being grown up. Her sleeves were rolled back to the
      elbow, and her slim arms dripped with water. Strands of brown hair were
      blowing loose in the evening breeze. To John she had never seemed so
      bewitchingly pretty. He stared at her till the pallor of her face gave way
      to a warm red glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood there, speechless, there came from the other side of the
      chimney, softly at first, then swelling, the sound of a child's voice,
      raised in a tentative wail. Betty started violently. The next moment she
      was gone, and from the unseen parts beyond the chimney came the noise of
      splashing water.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the same instant, through the trap, came a trampling of feet and
      the sound of whispering. The enemy had reached the top floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was conscious of a remarkable exhilaration. He felt insanely
      light-hearted. He laughed aloud at the thought that until then he had
      completely forgotten the very existence of these earnest seekers after his
      downfall. He threw back his head and shouted. There was something so
      ridiculous in their assumption that they mattered to a man who had found
      Betty again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his head down through the trap, to see what was going on. The
      dark passage was full of indistinct forms, gathered together in puzzled
      groups. The mystery of the vanished object of their pursuit was being
      discussed in hoarse whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was an excited shout, then a rush of feet. John drew back
      his head, and waited, gripping his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voices called to each other in the passage below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De roof!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On top de roof!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's beaten it for de roof!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Feet shuffled on the stone floor. The voices ceased abruptly. And then,
      like a jack-in-the-box, there popped through the trap a head and
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new arrival was a young man with a shock of red hair, a broken nose,
      and a mouth from which force or the passage of time had removed three
      front teeth. He held on to the edge of the trap, and stared up at John.
    </p>
    <p>
      John beamed down at him, and shifted his grip on the stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's here?" he cried. "Historic picture. 'Old Dr. Cook discovers the
      North Pole.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-headed young man blinked. The strong light of the open air was
      trying to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youse had best come down," he observed coldly. "We've got youse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," continued John, unmoved, "is instantly handed a gum-drop by his
      faithful Eskimo."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he brought the stick down on the knuckles which disfigured
      the edges of the trap. The intruder uttered a howl and dropped out of
      sight. In the passage below there were whisperings and mutterings, growing
      gradually louder till something resembling coherent conversation came to
      John's ears, as he knelt by the trap making meditative billiard shots with
      the stick at a small pebble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw g'wan! Don't be a quitter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's a quitter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youse a quitter. Get on top de roof. He can't hoit youse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "De guy's gotten a big stick."
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I and Theodore," he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      A somewhat baffled silence on the part of the attacking force was followed
      by further conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee! Some guy's got to go up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Murmur of assent from the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice, in inspired tones: "Let Sam do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion made a hit. There was no doubt about that. It was a success
      from the start. Quite a little chorus of voices expressed sincere approval
      of the very happy solution to what had seemed an insoluble problem. John,
      listening from above, failed to detect in the choir of glad voices one
      that might belong to Sam himself. Probably gratification had rendered the
      chosen one dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, let Sam do it," cried the unseen chorus. The first speaker,
      unnecessarily, perhaps&mdash;for the motion had been carried almost
      unanimously&mdash;but possibly with the idea of convincing the one member
      of the party in whose bosom doubts might conceivably be harbored, went on
      to adduce reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam bein' a coon," he argued, "ain't goin' to git hoit by no stick. Youse
      can't hoit a coon by soakin' him on de coco, can you, Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John waited with some interest for the reply, but it did not come.
      Possibly Sam did not wish to generalize on insufficient experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can but try," said John softly, turning the stick round in his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A report like a cannon sounded in the passage below. It was merely a
      revolver shot, but in the confined space it was deafening. The bullet sang
      up into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never hit me," said John cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise was succeeded by a shuffling of feet. John grasped his stick
      more firmly. This was evidently the real attack. The revolver shot had
      been a mere demonstration of artillery to cover the infantry's advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the next moment a woolly head popped through the opening, and
      a pair of rolling eyes gleamed up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Sam!" he said cordially, "this is great. Now for our interesting
      experiment. My idea is that you <i>can</i> hurt a coon's head with a stick
      if you hit it hard enough. Keep quite still. Now. What, are you coming up?
      Sam, I hate to do it, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A yell rang out. John's theory had been tested and proved correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the affair had begun to attract spectators. The noise of the
      revolver had proved a fine advertisement. The roof of the house next door
      began to fill up. Only a few of the occupants could get a clear view of
      the proceedings, for the chimney intervened. There was considerable
      speculation as to what was passing in the Three Points camp. John was the
      popular favorite. The early comers had seen his interview with Sam, and
      were relating it with gusto to their friends. Their attitude toward John
      was that of a group of men watching a dog at a rat hole. They looked to
      him to provide entertainment for them, but they realized that the first
      move must be with the attackers. They were fair-minded men, and they did
      not expect John to make any aggressive move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their indignation, when the proceedings began to grow slow, was directed
      entirely at the dilatory Three Pointers. They hooted the Three Pointers.
      They urged them to go home and tuck themselves up in bed. The spectators
      were mostly Irishmen, and it offended them to see what should have been a
      spirited fight so grossly bungled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "G'wan away home, ye quitters!" roared one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second member of the audience alluded to them as "stiffs."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the besieging army was beginning to grow a little
      unpopular. More action was needed if they were to retain the esteem of
      Broster Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there came another and a longer explosion from below, and more
      bullets wasted themselves on air. John sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me tired," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irish neighbors expressed the same sentiment in different and more
      forcible words. There was no doubt about it&mdash;as warriors, the Three
      Pointers were failing to give satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice from the passage called to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are youse comin' down off out of dat roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind repeating that remark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are youse goin' to quit off out of dat roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away and learn some grammar," said John severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are youse&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my son," said John, "since you ask it, I am not. I like being up
      here. How is Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence below. The time began to pass slowly. The Irishmen on
      the other roof, now definitely abandoning hope of further entertainment,
      proceeded with hoots of derision to climb down one by one into the
      recesses of their own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then from the street far below there came a fusillade of shots and a
      babel of shouts and counter-shouts. The roof of the house next door filled
      again with a magical swiftness, and the low wall facing the street became
      black with the backs of those craning over. There appeared to be great
      doings in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      John smiled comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the army of the corridor confusion had arisen. A scout, clattering
      upstairs, had brought the news of the Table Hillites' advent, and there
      was doubt as to the proper course to pursue. Certain voices urged going
      down to help the main body. Others pointed out that this would mean
      abandoning the siege of the roof. The scout who had brought the news was
      eloquent in favor of the first course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee!" he cried, "don't I keep tellin' youse dat de Table Hills is here?
      Sure, dere's a whole bunch of dem, and unless youse come on down dey'll
      bite de hull head off of us lot. Leave dat stiff on de roof. Let Sam wait
      here wit' his canister, and den he can't get down, 'cos Sam'll pump him
      full of lead while he's beatin' it t'roo de trapdoor. Sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is certainly something in that," he murmured. "I guess the grand
      rescue scene in the third act has sprung a leak. This will want thinking
      over."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street the disturbance had now become terrible. Both sides were
      hard at it, and the Irishmen on the roof, rewarded at last for their long
      vigil, were yelling encouragement promiscuously and whooping with the
      unfettered ecstasy of men who are getting the treat of their lives without
      having paid a penny for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behavior of the New York policeman in affairs of this kind is based on
      principles of the soundest practical wisdom. The unthinking man would rush
      in and attempt to crush the combat in its earliest and fiercest stages.
      The New York policeman, knowing the importance of his safety, and the
      insignificance of the gangsman's, permits the opposing forces to hammer
      each other into a certain distaste for battle, and then, when both sides
      have begun to have enough of it, rushes in himself and clubs everything in
      sight. It is an admirable process in its results, but it is sure rather
      than swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceedings in the affair below had not yet reached the
      police-interference stage. The noise, what with the shots and yells from
      the street and the ear-piercing approval of the roof audience, was just
      working up to a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      John rose. He was tired of kneeling by the trap, and there was no
      likelihood of Sam making another attempt to climb through. He got up and
      stretched himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw that Betty was standing beside him, holding with each hand
      a small and&mdash;by Broster Street standards&mdash;uncannily clean child.
      The children were scared and whimpering, and she stooped to soothe them.
      Then she turned to John, her eyes wide with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you hurt?" she cried. "What has been happening? Are you hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John's heart leaped at the anxious break in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right," he said soothingly. "It's absolutely all right.
      Everything's over."
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to give him the lie, the noise in the street swelled to a crescendo
      of yells and shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" cried Betty, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy," said John, "the police must be taking a hand. It's all right.
      There's a little trouble down below there between two of the gangs. It
      won't last long now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who were those men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friends in the passage?" he said lightly. "Those were some of the
      Three Points gang. We were holding the concluding exercise of a rather
      lively campaign that's been&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty leaned weakly against the chimney. There was silence now in the
      street. Only the distant rumble of an elevated train broke the stillness.
      She drew her hands from the children's grasp, and covered her face. As she
      lowered them again, John saw that the blood had left her cheeks. She was
      white and shaking. He moved forward impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tottered, reaching blindly for the chimney for support, and without
      further words he gathered her into his arms as if she had been the child
      she looked, and held her there, clutching her to him fiercely, kissing the
      brown hair that brushed against his face, and soothing her with vague
      murmurings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath came in broken gasps. She laughed hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought they were killing you&mdash;killing you&mdash;and I couldn't
      leave my babies&mdash;they were so frightened, poor little mites&mdash;I
      thought they were killing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arms about his neck tightened their grip convulsively, forcing his
      head down until his face rested against hers. And so they stood, rigid,
      while the two children stared with round eyes and whimpered unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grip relaxed. Her hands dropped slowly to her side. She leaned back
      against the circle of his arms, and looked up at him&mdash;a strange look,
      full of a sweet humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I was strong," she said quietly. "I'm weak&mdash;but I don't
      care."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with glowing eyes, not understanding, but content that
      the journey was ended, that she was there, in his arms, speaking to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always loved you, dear," she went on. "You knew that, didn't you? But I
      thought I was strong enough to give you up for&mdash;for a principle&mdash;but
      I was wrong. I can't do without you&mdash;I knew it just now when I saw&mdash;"
      She stopped, and shuddered. "I can't do without you," she repented.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the muscles of his arms quiver, and pressed more closely against
      them. They were strong arms, protecting arms, restful to lean against at
      the journey's end.

      CHAPTER XXVII &mdash; A LEMON
    </h2>
    <p>
      That bulwark of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, Pugsy Maloney, was rather the man
      of action than the man of tact. Otherwise, when, a moment later, he thrust
      his head up through the trap, he would have withdrawn delicately, and not
      split the silence with a raucous "Hey!" which acted on John and Betty like
      an electric shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      John glowered at him. Betty was pink, but composed. Pugsy climbed
      leisurely on to the roof, and surveyed the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, hello!" he said, as he saw Betty more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Pugsy," said Betty. "How are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John turned in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know Pugsy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty looked at him, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said Pugsy. "Miss Brown was stenographer on de poiper till she
      beat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Brown!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was utter bewilderment in John's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I changed my name when I went to <i>Peaceful Moments</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then are you&mdash;did you&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I wrote those articles. That's how I happen to be here now. I come
      down every day and help look after the babies. Poor little souls, there
      seems to be nobody else here who has time to do it. It's dreadful. Some of
      them&mdash;you wouldn't believe&mdash;I don't think they could ever have
      had a real bath in their lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baths is foolishness," commented Master Maloney austerely, eying the
      scoured infants with a touch of disfavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      John was reminded of a second mystery that needed solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How on earth did you get up here, Pugsy?" he asked. "How did you get past
      Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam? I didn't see no Sam. Who's Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of those fellows. A coon. They left him on guard with a gun, so that
      I shouldn't get down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I met a coon beating it down de stairs. I guess dat was him. I guess
      he got cold feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there's nothing to stop us from getting down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nope. Dat's right. Dere ain't a T'ree Pointer wit'in a mile. De cops have
      been loadin' dem into de patrol-wagon by de dozen."
    </p>
    <p>
      John turned to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll go and have dinner somewhere. You haven't begun to explain things
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty shook her head with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got time to go out to dinners," she said. "I'm a working-girl.
      I'm cashier at Fontelli's Italian Restaurant. I shall be on duty in
      another half-hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      John was aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a very good situation," said Betty demurely. "Six dollars a week and
      what I steal. I haven't stolen anything yet, and I think Mr. Jarvis is a
      little disappointed in me. But of course I haven't settled down properly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jarvis? Bat Jarvis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He has been very good to me. He got me this place, and has looked
      after me all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll buy him a thousand cats," said John fervently. "But, Betty, you
      mustn't go there any more. You must quit. You&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If <i>Peaceful Moments</i> would reengage me?" said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke lightly, but her face was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear," she said quickly, "I can't be away from you now, while there's
      danger. I couldn't bear it. Will you let me come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will. You must." Her manner changed again. "That's settled, then.
      Pugsy, I'm coming back to the paper. Are you glad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure t'ing," said Pugsy. "You're to de good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," she went on, "I must give these babies back to their mothers,
      and then I'll come with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered herself through the trap, and John handed the children down to
      her. Pugsy looked on, smoking a thoughtful cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      John drew a deep breath. Pugsy, removing the cigarette from his mouth,
      delivered himself of a stately word of praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a boid," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pugsy," said John, feeling in his pocket, and producing a roll of bills,
      "a dollar a word is our rate for contributions like that."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      John pushed back his chair slightly, stretched out his legs, and lighted a
      cigarette, watching Betty fondly through the smoke. The resources of the
      Knickerbocker Hotel had proved equal to supplying the staff of <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> with an excellent dinner, and John had stoutly declined to
      give or listen to any explanations until the coffee arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thousands of promising careers," he said, "have been ruined by the fatal
      practise of talking seriously at dinner. But now we might begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty looked at him across the table with shining eyes. It was good to be
      together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My explanations won't take long," she said. "I ran away from you. And,
      when you found me, I ran away again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I didn't find you," objected John. "That was my trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my aunt told you I was at <i>Peaceful Moments</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I didn't even know you had an aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she's not exactly that. She's my stepfather's aunt&mdash;Mrs.
      Oakley. I was certain you had gone straight to her, and that she had told
      you where I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Mrs. Oakley? The&mdash;er&mdash;philanthropist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't laugh at her," said Betty quickly. "She was so good to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She passes," said John decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," said Betty, "it's your turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      John lighted another cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My story," he said, "is rather longer. When they threw me out of Mervo&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you don't keep abreast of European history," he said. "Haven't
      you heard of the great revolution in Mervo and the overthrow of the
      dynasty? Bloodless, but invigorating. The populace rose against me as one
      man&mdash;except good old General Poineau. He was for me, and Crump was
      neutral, but apart from them my subjects were unanimous. There's a
      republic again in Mervo now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why? What had you done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I abolished the gaming-tables. But, more probably," he went on
      quickly, "they saw what a perfect dub I was in every&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that, just because of me&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said awkwardly, "as a matter of fact what you said did make me
      think over my position, and, of course, directly I thought over it&mdash;oh,
      well, anyway, I closed down gambling in Mervo, and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "John!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of a small hand creeping round the table under cover of the
      cloth. He pressed it swiftly, and, looking round, caught the eye of a
      hovering waiter, who swooped like a respectful hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you want anything, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got it, thanks," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, directly they had fired me, I came over here. I don't know what I
      expected to do. I suppose I thought I might find you by chance. I pretty
      soon saw how hopeless it was, and it struck me that, if I didn't get some
      work to do mighty quick, I shouldn't be much good to anyone except the
      alienists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter stared, but John's eyes stopped him in mid-swoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I found Smith&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Mr. Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In prison," said John with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In prison!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He resisted and assaulted the police. I'll tell you about it later. Well,
      Smith told me of the alterations in <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, and I saw
      that it was just the thing for me. And it has occupied my mind quite some.
      To think of you being the writer of those Broster Street articles! You
      certainly have started something, Betty! Goodness knows where it will end.
      I hoped to have brought off a coup this afternoon, but the arrival of Sam
      and his friends just spoiled it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This afternoon? Yes, why were you there? What were you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was interviewing the collector of rents and trying to dig his
      employer's name out of him. It was Smith's idea. Smith's theory was that
      the owner of the tenements must have some special private reason for lying
      low, and that he would employ some special fellow, whom he could trust, as
      a rent-collector. And I'm pretty certain he was right. I cornered the
      collector, a little, rabbit-faced man named Gooch, and I believe he was on
      the point of&mdash;What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's forehead was wrinkled. Her eyes wore a far-away expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm trying to remember something. I seem to know the name, Gooch. And I
      seem to associate it with a little, rabbit-faced man. And&mdash;quick,
      tell me some more about him. He's just hovering about on the edge of my
      memory. Quick! Push him in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John threw his mind back to the interview in the dark passage, trying to
      reconstruct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's small," he said slowly. "His eyes protrude&mdash;so do his teeth&mdash;He&mdash;he&mdash;yes,
      I remember now&mdash;he has a curious red mark&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On his right cheek," said Betty triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove!" cried John. "You've got him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember him perfectly. He was&mdash;" She stopped with a little gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, he was one of my stepfather's secretaries," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be," said John at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can. It is. He must be. He has scores of interests everywhere. He
      prides himself on it. It's the most natural thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      John shook his head doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why all the fuss? Your stepfather isn't the man to mind public
      opinion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you see? It's as Mr. Smith said. The private reason. It's as
      clear as daylight. Naturally he would do anything rather than be found
      out. Don't you see? Because of Mrs. Oakley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because of Mrs. Oakley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know her as I do. She is a curious mixture. She's
      double-natured. You called her the philanthropist just now. Well, she
      would be one, if&mdash;if she could bear to part with money. Yes, I know
      it sounds ridiculous. But it's so. She is mean about money, but she
      honestly hates to hear of anybody treating poor people badly. If my
      stepfather were really the owner of those tenements, and she should find
      it out, she would have nothing more to do with him. It's true. I know
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile passed away from John's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George!" he said. "It certainly begins to hang together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know I'm right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat meditating for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, what are we to do? Do we go on with this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on with it? I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean&mdash;well, it has become rather a family matter, you see. Do you
      feel as&mdash;warlike against Mr. Scobell as you did against an unknown
      lessee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I should feel any different if&mdash;if it was you," she
      said. "I've been spending days and days in those houses, John dear, and
      I've seen such utter squalor and misery, where there needn't be any at all
      if only the owner would do his duty, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped. Her eyes were misty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thumbs down, in fact," said John, nodding. "I'm with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, two men came down the broad staircase into the grill-room.
      Betty's back was towards them, but John saw them, and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you looking at?" asked Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you count ten before looking round?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your stepfather has just come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's sitting at the other side of the room, directly behind you. Count
      ten!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty had twisted round in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where? Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just where you're looking. Don't let him see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't&mdash; Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The plot thickens, eh?" he said. "What is Mr. Scobell doing in New York,
      I wonder, if he has not come to keep an eye on his interests?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had whipped round again. Her face was white with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true," she whispered. "I was right. Do you see who that is with him?
      The man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know him? He's a stranger to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Mr. Parker," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      John drew in his breath sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positive."
    </p>
    <p>
      John laughed quietly. He thought for a moment, then beckoned to the
      hovering waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?" asked Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring me a small lemon," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lemon squash, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a lemon squash. A plain lemon. The fruit of that name. The common or
      garden citron, which is sharp to the taste and not pleasant to have handed
      to one. Also a piece of note paper, a little tissue paper, and an
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?" asked Betty again.
    </p>
    <p>
      John beamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever read the Sherlock Holmes story entitled 'The Five Orange
      Pips'? Well, when a man in that story received a mysterious envelope
      containing five orange pips, it was a sign that he was due to get his. It
      was all over, as far as he was concerned, except 'phoning for the
      undertaker. I propose to treat Mr. Scobell better than that. He shall have
      a whole lemon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter returned. John wrapped up the lemon carefully, wrote on the
      note paper the words, "To B. Scobell, Esq., Property Owner, Broster
      Street, from Prince John of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, this gift," and
      enclosed it in the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see that gentleman at the table by the pillar?" he said. "Give him
      these. Just say a gentleman sent them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter smiled doubtfully. John added a two-dollar bill to the
      collection in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't give him that," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter smiled again, but this time not doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," said John as the messenger ambled off, "perhaps it would be
      just as well if we retired."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII &mdash; THE FINAL ATTEMPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Proof that his shot had not missed its mark was supplied to John
      immediately upon his arrival at the office on the following morning, when
      he was met by Pugsy Maloney with the information that a gentleman had
      called to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With or without a black-jack?" enquired John. "Did he give any name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure. Parker's his name. He blew in oncst before when Mr. Smith was here.
      I loosed him into de odder room."
    </p>
    <p>
      John walked through. The man he had seen with Mr. Scobell at the
      Knickerbocker was standing at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Parker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other turned, as the door opened, and looked at him keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you Mr. Maude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess you don't need to be told what I've come about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here," said Mr. Parker. "I don't know how you've found things out,
      but you've done it, and we're through. We quit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad of that," said John. "Would you mind informing Spider Reilly of
      that fact? It will make life pleasanter for all of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Scobell sent me along here to ask you to come and talk over this
      thing with him. He's at the Knickerbocker. I've a cab waiting outside. Can
      you come along?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather he came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I bet he'd rather come here than be where he is. That little surprise
      packet of yours last night put him down and out. Gave him a stroke of some
      sort. He's in bed now, with half-a-dozen doctors working on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      John thought for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," he said slowly, "if it's that&mdash;very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help feeling a touch of remorse. He had no reason to be fond
      of Mr. Scobell, but he was sorry that this should have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out on the street. A taximeter cab was standing by the sidewalk.
      They got in. Neither spoke. John was thoughtful and preoccupied. Mr.
      Parker, too, appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts. He sat with
      folded arms and lowered head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab buzzed up Fifth Avenue. Suddenly something, half-seen through the
      window, brought John to himself with a jerk. It was the great white mass
      of the Plaza Hotel. The next moment he saw that they were abreast of the
      park, and for the first time an icy wave of suspicion swept over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, what's this?" he cried. "Where are you taking me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker's right hand came swiftly out of ambush, and something gleamed
      in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't move," said Mr. Parker. The hard nozzle of a pistol pressed against
      John's chest. "Keep that hand still."
    </p>
    <p>
      John dropped his hand. Mr. Parker leaned back, with the pistol resting
      easily on his knee. The cab began to move more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      John's mind was in a whirl. His chief emotion was not fear, but disgust
      that he should have allowed himself to be trapped, with such absurd ease.
      He blushed for himself. Mr. Parker's face was expressionless, but who
      could say what tumults of silent laughter were not going on inside him?
      John bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said John again. "What's the next move?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It flashed across his mind that, unless driven to it by an attack, his
      captor would do nothing for the moment without running grave risks
      himself. To shoot now would be to attract attention. The cab would be
      overtaken at once by bicycle police, and stopped. There would be no
      escape. No, nothing could happen till they reached open country. At least
      he would have time to think this matter over in all its bearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker ignored the question. He was sitting in the same attitude of
      watchfulness, the revolver resting on his knee. He seemed mistrustful of
      John's right hand, which was hanging limply at his side. It was from this
      quarter that he appeared to expect attack. The cab was bowling easily up
      the broad street, past rows and rows of high houses each looking exactly
      the same as the last. Occasionally, to the right, through a break in the
      line of buildings, a glimpse of the river could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint hope occurred to John that, by talking, he might put the other off
      his guard for just that instant which was all he asked. He exerted himself
      to find material for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," he said, "what you said about Mr. Scobell, was that true? About
      his being ill in bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker did not answer, but a wintry smile flittered across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not?" said John. "Well, I'm glad of that. I don't wish Mr. Scobell
      any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker looked at him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, why are you in this game at all?" he said. "What made you butt in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One must do something," said John. "It's interesting work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'll quit&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      John shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own it's a tempting proposition, things being as they are, but I won't
      give up yet. You never know what may happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can make a mighty near guess this trip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't do a thing yet, that's sure," said John confidently. "If you
      shot me now, the cab would be stopped, and you would be lynched by the
      populace. I seem to see them tearing you limb from limb. 'She loves me!'
      Off comes an arm. 'She loves me not!' A leg joins the little heap on the
      ground. That is what would happen, Mr. Parker."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shrugged his shoulders, and relapsed into silence once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do with me, Mr. Parker?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker did not reply.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The cab moved swiftly on. Now they had reached the open country. An
      occasional wooden shack was passed, but that was all. At any moment, John
      felt, the climax of the drama might be reached, and he got ready. His
      muscles stiffened for a spring. There was little chance of its being
      effective, but at least it would be good to put up some kind of a fight.
      And he had a faint hope that the suddenness of his movement might upset
      the other's aim. He was bound to be hit somewhere. That was certain. But
      quickness might save him to some extent. He braced his leg against the
      back of the cab. And, as he did so, its smooth speed changed to a series
      of jarring jumps, each more emphatic than the last. It slowed down, then
      came to a halt. There was a thud, as the chauffeur jumped down. John heard
      him fumbling in the tool box. Presently the body of the machine was raised
      slightly as he got to work with the jack. John's muscles relaxed. He
      leaned back. Surely something could be made of this new development. But
      the hand that held the revolver never wavered. He paused, irresolute. And
      at the moment somebody spoke in the road outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had a breakdown?" enquired the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      John recognized it. It was the voice of Kid Brady.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Kid, as he had stated that he intended to do, had begun his training
      for his match with Eddie Wood at White Plains. It was his practise to open
      a course of training with a little gentle road-work, and it was while
      jogging along the highway a couple of miles from his training camp, in
      company with the two thick-necked gentlemen who acted as his sparring
      partners, that he had come upon the broken-down taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this had happened after his training had begun in real earnest, he
      would have averted his eyes from the spectacle, however alluring, and
      continued on his way without a pause. But now, as he had not yet settled
      down to genuine hard work, he felt justified in turning aside and looking
      into the matter. The fact that the chauffeur, who seemed to be a taciturn
      man, lacking the conversational graces, manifestly objected to an
      audience, deterred him not at all. One cannot have everything in this
      world, and the Kid and his attendant thick-necks were content to watch the
      process of mending the tire, without demanding the additional joy of
      sparkling small talk from the man in charge of the operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guy's had a breakdown, sure," said the first of the thick-necks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surest thing you know," agreed his colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to me the tire's punctured," said the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three concentrated their gaze on the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kid's right," said thick-neck number one. "Guy's been an' bust a tire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surest thing you know," said thick-neck number two.
    </p>
    <p>
      They observed the perspiring chauffeur in silence for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder how he did that, now?" speculated the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ran over a nail, I guess," said thick-neck number one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surest thing you know," said the other, who, while perhaps somewhat
      deficient in the matter of original thought, was a most useful fellow to
      have by one&mdash;a sort of Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you run over a nail?" the Kid enquired of the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur worked on, unheeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is his busy day," said the first thick-neck, with satire. "Guy's too
      full of work to talk to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deaf, shouldn't wonder," surmised the Kid. "Say, wonder what's he doing
      with a taxi so far out of the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some guy tells him to drive him out here, I guess. Say, it'll cost him
      something, too. He'll have to strip off a few from his roll to pay for
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      John glanced at Mr. Parker, quivering with excitement. It was his last
      chance. Would the Kid think to look inside the cab, or would he move on?
      Could he risk a shout?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker leaned forward, and thrust the muzzle of the pistol against his
      body. The possibilities of the situation had evidently not been lost upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep quiet," he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the conversation had begun again, and the Kid had made his
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty rich guy inside," he said, following up his companion's train of
      thought. "I'm going to rubber through the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      John met Mr. Parker's eye, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the sound of the Kid's feet grating on the road, as he turned,
      and, as he heard it, Mr. Parker for the first time lost his head. With a
      vague idea of screening John, he half-rose. The pistol wavered. It was the
      chance John had prayed for. His left hand shot out, grasped the other's
      wrist, and gave it a sharp wrench. The pistol went off with a deafening
      report, the bullet passing through the back of the cab, then fell to the
      floor, as the fingers lost their hold. And the next moment John's right
      fist, darting upward, crashed home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was instantaneous. John had risen from his seat as he delivered
      the blow, and it got the full benefit of his weight. Mr. Parker literally
      crumpled up. His head jerked, then fell limply forward. John pushed him on
      to the seat as he slid toward the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interested face of the Kid appeared at the window. Behind him could be
      seen portions of the faces of the two thick-necks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Kid," said John. "I heard your voice. I hoped you might look in
      for a chat."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid stared, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's doin'?" he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good deal. I'll explain later. First, will you kindly knock that
      chauffeur down and sit on his head?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "De guy's beat it," volunteered the first thick-neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surest thing you know," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's been doin'?" asked the Kid. "What are you going to do with this
      guy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John inspected the prostrate Mr. Parker, who had begun to stir slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess we'll leave him here," he said. "I've had all of his company that
      I need for to-day. Show me the nearest station, Kid. I must be getting
      back to New York. I'll tell you all about it as we go. A walk will do me
      good. Riding in a taxi is pleasant, but, believe me, you can have too much
      of it."

      CHAPTER XXIX &mdash; A REPRESENTATIVE GATHERING
    </h2>
    <p>
      When John returned to the office, he found that his absence had been
      causing Betty an anxious hour's waiting. She had been informed by Pugsy
      that he had gone out in the company of Mr. Parker, and she felt uneasy.
      She turned white at his story of the ride, but he minimized the dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he ever meant to shoot. I think he was going to shut me up
      somewhere out there, and keep me till I promised to be good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think my stepfather told him to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it. I fancy Parker is a man who acts a good deal on his own
      inspirations. But we'll ask him, when he calls to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he going to call?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an idea he will," said John. "I sent him a note just now, asking
      if he could manage a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate, in the light of subsequent events, that Mr. Jarvis
      should have seen fit to bring with him to the office that afternoon two of
      his collection of cats, and that Long Otto, who, as before, accompanied
      him, should have been fired by his example to the extent of introducing a
      large yellow dog. For before the afternoon was ended, space in the office
      was destined to be at premium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarvis, when he had recovered from the surprise of seeing Betty and
      learning that she had returned to her old situation, explained:
    </p>
    <p>
      "T'ought I'd bring de kits along," he said. "Dey starts fuss'n' wit' each
      odder yesterday, so I brings dem along."
    </p>
    <p>
      John inspected the menagerie without resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure!" he said. "They add a kind of peaceful touch to the scene."
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere was, indeed, one of peace. The dog, after an inquisitive
      journey round the room, lay down and went to sleep. The cats settled
      themselves comfortably, one on each of Mr. Jarvis' knees. Long Otto,
      surveying the ceiling with his customary glassy stare, smoked a long
      cigar. And Bat, scratching one of the cats under the ear, began to
      entertain John with some reminiscences of fits and kittens.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the peace did not last. Ten minutes had barely elapsed when the dog,
      sitting up with a start, uttered a whine. The door burst open and a little
      man dashed in. He was brown in the face, and had evidently been living
      recently in the open air. Behind him was a crowd of uncertain numbers.
      They were all strangers to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man glared speechlessly at the occupants of the room. The two
      Bowery boys rose awkwardly. The cats fell to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the party had entered. Betty recognized the Reverend Edwin T.
      Philpotts and Mr. B. Henderson Asher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Renshaw," said the little man, having found speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do for you?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question appeared to astound the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you&mdash;! Of all&mdash;!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Renshaw is the editor of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>," she said. "Mr.
      Smith was only acting for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw caught the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Mr. Smith. I want to see Mr. Smith. Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In prison," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In prison!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good many things have happened since you left for your vacation. Smith
      assaulted a policeman, and is now on Blackwell's Island."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw gasped. Mr. B. Henderson Asher stared, and stumbled over the
      cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who are you?" asked the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Maude. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, to turn his attention to Mr. Jarvis and Mr. Asher, between
      whom unpleasantness seemed to have arisen. Mr. Jarvis, holding a cat in
      his arms, was scowling at Mr. Asher, who had backed away and appeared
      apprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the trouble?" asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dis guy here wit' two left feet," said Bat querulously, "treads on de
      kit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw, eying Bat and the silent Otto with disgust, intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are these persons?" he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poison yourself," rejoined Bat, justly incensed. "Who's de little squirt,
      Mr. Maude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John waved his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, gentlemen," he said, "why descend to mere personalities? I
      ought to have introduced you. This is Mr. Renshaw, our editor. These, Mr.
      Renshaw, are Bat Jarvis and Long Otto, our acting fighting editors, vice
      Kid Brady, absent on unavoidable business."
    </p>
    <p>
      The name stung Mr. Renshaw to indignation, as Smith's had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brady!" he shrilled. "I insist that you give me a full explanation. I go
      away by my doctor's orders for a vacation, leaving Mr. Smith to conduct
      the paper on certain clearly defined lines. By mere chance, while on my
      vacation, I saw a copy of the paper. It had been ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ruined?" said John. "On the contrary. The circulation has been going up
      every week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is this person, Brady? With Mr. Philpotts I have been going carefully
      over the numbers which have been issued since my departure&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An intellectual treat," murmured John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;and in each there is a picture of this young man in a costume
      which I will not particularize&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is hardly enough of it to particularize."
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;together with a page of disgusting autobiographical matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      John held up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I protest," he said. "We court criticism, but this is mere abuse. I
      appeal to these gentlemen to say whether this, for instance, is not bright
      and interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the current number of <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, and turned to
      the Kid's page.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," he said, "describes a certain ten-round unpleasantness with one
      Mexican Joe. 'Joe comes up for the second round and he gives me a nasty
      look, but I thinks of my mother and swats him one in the lower ribs. He
      gives me another nasty look. "All right, Kid," he says; "now I'll knock
      you up into the gallery." And with that he cuts loose with a right swing,
      but I falls into the clinch, and then&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pah!" exclaimed Mr. Renshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, boss," urged Mr. Jarvis approvingly. "It's to de good, dat stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" said John triumphantly. "You heard? Mr. Jarvis, one of the most
      firmly established critics east of Fifth Avenue stamps Kid Brady's
      reminiscences with the hall-mark of his approval."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I falls fer de Kid every time," assented Mr. Jarvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! You know a good thing when you see one. Why," he went on warmly,
      "there is stuff in these reminiscences which would stir the blood of a
      jellyfish. Let me quote you another passage, to show that they are not
      only enthralling, but helpful as well. Let me see, where is it? Ah, I have
      it. 'A bully good way of putting a guy out of business is this. You don't
      want to use it in the ring, because rightly speaking it's a foul, but you
      will find it mighty useful if any thick-neck comes up to you in the street
      and tries to start anything. It's this way. While he's setting himself for
      a punch, just place the tips of the fingers of your left hand on the right
      side of the chest. Then bring down the heel of your left hand. There isn't
      a guy living that could stand up against that. The fingers give you a
      leverage to beat the band. The guy doubles up, and you upper-cut him with
      your right, and out he goes.' Now, I bet you never knew that before, Mr.
      Philpotts. Try it on your parishioners."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Peaceful Moments</i>," said Mr. Renshaw irately, "is no medium for
      exploiting low prize-fighters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Low prize-fighters! No, no! The Kid is as decent a little chap as you'd
      meet anywhere. And right up in the championship class, too! He's matched
      against Eddie Wood at this very moment. And Mr. Waterman will support me
      in my statement that a victory over Eddie Wood means that he gets a
      cast-iron claim to meet Jimmy Garvin for the championship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is abominable," burst forth Mr. Renshaw. "It is disgraceful. The paper
      is ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You keep saying that. It really isn't so. The returns are excellent.
      Prosperity beams on us like a sun. The proprietor is more than satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Mr. Renshaw sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw laughed an acid laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may not know it," he said, "but Mr. Scobell is in New York at this
      very moment. We arrived together yesterday on the <i>Mauretania</i>. I was
      spending my vacation in England when I happened to see the copy of the
      paper. I instantly communicated with Mr. Scobell, who was at Mervo, an
      island in the Mediterranean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seem to know the name&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;and received in reply a long cable desiring me to return to New
      York immediately. I sailed on the <i>Mauretania</i>, and found that he was
      one of the passengers. He was extremely agitated, let me tell you. So that
      your impudent assertion that the proprietor is pleased&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      John raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite understand," he said. "From what you say, one would almost
      imagine that you thought Mr. Scobell was the proprietor of this paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw stared. Everyone stared, except Mr. Jarvis, who, since the
      readings from the Kid's reminiscences had ceased, had lost interest in the
      proceedings, and was now entertaining the cats with a ball of paper tied
      to a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought that Mr. Scobell&mdash;?" repeated Mr. Renshaw. "Who is, if he is
      not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" cried Mr. Renshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" exclaimed Mr. Waterman, Mr. Asher, and the Reverend Edwin T.
      Philpotts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure thing," said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw groped for a chair, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I going mad?" he demanded feebly. "Do I understand you to say that you
      own this paper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roughly speaking, about three days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his audience (still excepting Mr. Jarvis, who was tickling one of
      the cats and whistling a plaintive melody) there was a tendency toward
      awkward silence. To start assailing a seeming nonentity and then to
      discover he is the proprietor of the paper to which you wish to contribute
      is like kicking an apparently empty hat and finding your rich uncle inside
      it. Mr. Renshaw in particular was disturbed. Editorships of the kind to
      which he aspired are not easy to get. If he were to be removed from <i>Peaceful
      Moments</i> he would find it hard to place himself anywhere else. Editors,
      like manuscripts, are rejected from want of space.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a little money to invest," continued John. "And it seemed to me
      that I couldn't do better than put it into <i>Peaceful Moments</i>. If it
      did nothing else, it would give me a free hand in pursuing a policy in
      which I was interested. Smith told me that Mr. Scobell's representatives
      had instructions to accept any offer, so I made an offer, and they jumped
      at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pugsy Maloney entered, bearing a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask him to wait just one moment," said John, reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Mr. Renshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Renshaw," he said, "if you took hold of the paper again, helped by
      these other gentlemen, do you think you could gather in our old
      subscribers and generally make the thing a live proposition on the old
      lines? Because, if so, I should be glad if you would start in with the
      next number. I am through with the present policy. At least, I hope to be
      in a few minutes. Do you think you can undertake that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Renshaw, with a sigh of relief, intimated that he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said John. "And now I'm afraid I must ask you to go. A rather
      private and delicate interview is in the offing. Bat, I'm very much
      obliged to you and Otto for your help. I don't know what we should have
      done without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, Chee!" said Mr. Jarvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then good-by for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, boss. Good-by, loidy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Long Otto pulled his forelock, and, accompanied by the cats and the dog,
      they left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Renshaw and the others had followed them, John rang the bell for
      Pugsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask Mr. Scobell to step in," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of many enterprises entered. His appearance had deteriorated since
      John had last met him. He had the air of one who has been caught in the
      machinery. His face was even sallower than of yore, and there was no gleam
      in his dull green eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started at the sight of Betty, but he was evidently too absorbed in the
      business in hand to be surprised at seeing her. He sank into a chair, and
      stared gloomily at John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," observed Mr. Scobell simply, "is hell." He drew a cigar stump
      mechanically from his vest pocket and lighted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do about it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you?" said John. "It's up to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell gazed heavily into vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever since I started in to monkey with that darned Mervo," he said sadly,
      "there ain't a thing gone right. I haven't been able to turn around
      without bumping into myself. Everything I touch turns to mud. I guess I
      can still breathe, but I'm not betting on that lasting long. Of all the
      darned hoodoos that island was the worst. Say, I gotta close down that
      Casino. What do you know about that! Sure thing. The old lady won't stand
      for it. I had a letter from her." He turned to Betty. "You got her all
      worked up, Betty. I'm not blaming you. It's just my jinx. She took it into
      her head I'd been treating you mean, and she kicked at the Casino. I gotta
      close it down or nix on the heir thing. That was enough for me. I'm going
      to turn it into a hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      He relighted his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, just as I got her smoothed down, along comes this darned
      tenement business. Say, Prince, for the love of Mike cut it out. If those
      houses are as bad as you say they are, and the old lady finds out that I
      own them, it'll be Katie bar the door for me. She wouldn't stand for it
      for a moment. I guess I didn't treat you good, Prince, but let's forget
      it. Ease up on this rough stuff. I'll do anything you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We only want you to make the houses fit to live in," she said. "I don't
      believe you know what they're like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no. I left Parker in charge. It was up to him to do what was wanted.
      Say, Prince, I want to talk to you about that guy, Parker. I understand
      he's been rather rough with you and your crowd. That wasn't my doing. I
      didn't know anything about it till he told me. It's the darned Wild West
      strain in him coming out. He used to do those sort of things out there,
      and he's forgotten his manners. I pay him well, and I guess he thinks
      that's the way it's up to him to earn it. You mustn't mind Parker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well! So long as he means well&mdash;!" said John. "I've no grudge
      against Parker. I've settled with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, what about this Broster Street thing? You want me to fix some
      improvements, is that it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, say, I'll do that. Sure. And then you'll quit handing out the
      newspaper stories? That goes. I'll start right in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's taken a heap off my mind," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's just one other thing," said John. "Have you by any chance such a
      thing as a stepfather's blessing on you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      John took Betty's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've come round to your views, Mr. Scobell," he said. "That scheme of
      yours for our future looks good to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scobell bit through his cigar in his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, why the Heck," he moaned, "couldn't you have had the sense to do
      that before, and save all this trouble?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX &mdash; CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Smith drew thoughtfully at his cigar, and shifted himself more comfortably
      into his chair. It was long since he had visited the West, and he had
      found all the old magic in the still, scented darkness of the prairie
      night. He gave a little sigh of content. When John, a year before, had
      announced his intention of buying this ranch, and, as it seemed to Smith,
      burying himself alive a thousand miles from anywhere, he had disapproved.
      He had pointed out that John was not doing what Fate expected of him. A
      miracle, in the shape of a six-figure wedding present from Mrs. Oakley,
      who had never been known before, in the memory of man, to give away a
      millionth of that sum, had happened to him. Fate, argued Smith, plainly
      intended him to stay in New York and spend his money in a civilized way.
    </p>
    <p>
      John had had only one reply, but it was clinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betty likes the idea," he said, and Smith ceased to argue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as he sat smoking on the porch on the first night of his inaugural
      visit to the ranch, a conviction was creeping over him that John had
      chosen wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened behind him. Betty came out on to the porch, and dropped into
      a chair close to where John's cigar glowed redly in the darkness. They sat
      there without speaking. The stirring of unseen cattle in the corral made a
      soothing accompaniment to thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very pleasant for an old jail bird like myself," said Smith at
      last, "to sit here at my ease. I wish all our absent friends could be with
      us to-night. Or perhaps not quite all. Let us say, Comrade Parker here,
      Comrades Brady and Maloney over there by you, and our old friend Renshaw
      sharing the floor with B. Henderson Asher, Bat Jarvis, and the cats. By
      the way, I was round at Broster Street before I left New York. There is
      certainly an improvement. Millionaires now stop there instead of going on
      to the Plaza. Are you asleep, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent. I also saw Comrade Brady before I left. He has definitely got
      on his match with Jimmy Garvin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. He'll win."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The papers seem to think so. <i>Peaceful Moments</i>, however, I am sorry
      to say, is silent on the subject. It was not like this in the good old
      days. How is the paper going now, John? Are the receipts satisfactory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty fair. Renshaw is rather a marvel in his way. He seems to have
      roped in nearly all the old subscribers. They eat out of his hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith stretched himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These," he said, "are the moments in life to which we look back with that
      wistful pleasure. This peaceful scene, John, will remain with me when I
      have forgotten that such a man as Spider Reilly ever existed. These are
      the real Peaceful Moments."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes. The cigar dropped from his fingers. There was a long
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Smith," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's asleep," said John. "He had a long journey to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty drew her chair closer. From somewhere out in the darkness, from the
      direction of the men's quarters, came the soft tinkle of a guitar and a
      voice droning a Mexican love-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand stole out and found his. They began to talk in whispers.
